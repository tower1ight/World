Running throughout Xylaan is a vast and dense mycelial network, this makes makes up the body of Xylaans godly form. The network grants low level psionic connection to all those that have bonded to it. This process involves taking in and growing a spore, primarily referred to as a "[[Germ]]" of the network in ones body. This piece of the network is disconnected from Xylaan (E) itself, and several variations of this germ have been crafted and engineered to provide a wide variety of additional effects. The network constantly emits signal radially from its flesh, similar to that of a magnetic field emitted by a wire with active current. The strength of ones connection is primarily dependent on proximity.

The fleshy mycelium of the [[Xylaan (entity)]] supports the entire function of the xylanni ecosystem, It transports resources from place to place,
