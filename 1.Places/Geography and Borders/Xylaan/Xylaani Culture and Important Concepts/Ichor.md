Both the biodiversity and mega-flora and mega-fauna found in [[Xylaan]] are supported by the presence of sugar an energy dense molecule produced and released in abundance by nearly all things capable of photosynthesis. Typically very difficult to break down, even for those producing it, an organisms symbiotic relationship with its [[Germ]] allows them to use this energy source with ease. This however comes at a cost, if deprived of {sugar} a germ will look for energy wherever they can find it, leaving its host emaciated and eventually dead.

Advanced sugars that enhance your [[focus]] and biological limits lol idk man what do you want from me its forest cocaine
