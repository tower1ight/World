 # What are skiffs
 - Vehicles used throughout xylaan to travel, transport goods, facilitate 
 - Skiffs often generate the bulk of the fuels used for their propulsion and suspension in the air through filter feeding.
 - the thick [[Germ]] layer that sits just above the treeline and provides fuel for these vehicles, ultimately limits visibility out to 20 ft, requiring alternative methods of navigation
	 - this germ layer acts as a relay circet,  promoting the "xylaani wifi"
	 - this alternative method of navigation is dependent entirely on maps and charted paths used by the mycelium
 - the teratory so to speak isdue to the thick fog high above the tree line skiffs largely depend on the mycelium for navigation
