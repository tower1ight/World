*"When one walks through xylaan they are met with the thoughts and voices of every organism within ten miles. These sounds meld together into an indescribable clamor, though the more time I spend here, the more I feel this place as a song, voices chanting against eachother and then something entirely different, a thread pulling me, an object trying to render itself in my head, all of it just beyond my comprehension"*

 # Polyphony
The Polyphony is the phenomena of hearing unique sounds within the combination of several pieces of music played concurrently. Hearing things in the convergence of multiple songs.

In Xylaan if a [[Germ|spore]] has melded with your biology, when you make contact with the [[mycelium]] network you are capable of integrating with it, forming a symbiotic relationship. Ultimately connecting you with everything that's part of the network. This results in near instant telepathic communication throughout [[Xylaan (location)]]. However, this communication and connection requires [[focus]]. Almost all things in [[Xylaan (location)]] are capable of a level of complex focus that enables telepathic communication. However, some are truly skilled and are capable of expanding their perception through practice with focus.[^1] 

This telepathic communication is instantaneous when connected to the network[^2] This instant communication coupled with the [[sugars]] enhancement of your mental capacity [^3] allows extremely high limits for complexity of messages and almost no obscurity in the reception of the messages content.  Communication is run through  encoded knowledge, essentially sharing files to others through telepathic transmissions. This means there is little to no written communication as we see it. many things connected to the network are inherently [[psionics|psionic]],  giving off constant transmissions of data stored locally in the [[mycelium]].[^4]  Rather than written work, these magical signatures give off a certain impression that acts as an access point for their data in the [[mycelium| network]][^5]

This form of communication is inherently magical as it is ultra refined and perfectly conceptualized though, sending and receiving messages takes significant [[focus]] and [[soul]] generation. 

because these transitions and signatures have complex and fluid ideas concerning what a given thing is and who has access to what knowledge regarding it, everything is encrypted, [[Xylaan (entity)|god]]  is in complete control of the [[mycelium]] (as it is the flesh of their body) and therefore have complete control over the dissemination of that knowledge. If you are within the network you can visualize and comprehend data, [[Xylaan (entity)|god]], through the [[Germ|spore]], gives you the ability to decrypt the constant stream of code.[^6]

Returning to the file analogy, different kinds of information are used for different purposes, some filetypes are better at sending some types of thought. Not all of these networks meld together for everything,  [[symbiotic groups]] have their own syntax and types of encoded thought that are better for various tasks.  Example: One of these [[xylaani languages]] is extremely proficient at evocative connection, allowing direct communication of feelings.  

because access to the [[mycelium]] is driven by the [[Germ]] and the [[Xylaan (entity)]], and because different [[xylaani languages]] are engines for processing different information, the syntax and underlying encrypted code of communication and is entirely different between languages, each requiring distinct information to decrypt and have access to these languages.[^7]

This access is no simple thing to acquire, one must work hard or be born into a community to gain the privilege of joining their network.

With all this context we return to polyphony, if one melds with the [[Xylaan (entity)]] via a [[Germ|spore]], they walk through the forest hearing a cacophony of telepathic thought, each language echoing through the minds of the community. 

 # Languages and Factions
  ## embeded language
- entangled (working against signal degradation)\
	- evocative
	- vague, almost like divination
	- draws attention and signal boosting 
- spoken by magical adepts (large file, complex concepts, thermodynamics)
	- Very clear and detailed concepts with little signal loss
	- Vacuole
- goblins( working to focus and direct lots of voices )
	- Behavior to emphasize
		- collaboration
		- nastiness and erratic behavior
	- show the thing wearing without xylaan and with discent 
	- almost a Ai algorithm, looking to reach consensus
		- constant voting tally 
		- more hive mind than other languages, 
		- very high empathy with simultaneous empathy shutdown
			- susceptible to manipulation as conviction drives the strength of the signal
		- individuality is built into the language to drive healthy dialogue: incentivizes collaboration as well as quick erratic deviation from the norm to test ideas
		- Stuborn NPCs have power
	- Thrive at finding solutions if given vague objectives 
	- 

- 

- Makes them excellent scouts, yet easy to distract

- the longer an idea takes form in the language the more ingrained the system is 

-

  

- What does talking about a real threat look like: one person notices threat, germ boosts signal sending anxiety and the general concept through local goblins, they process the sample and assess the threat, boosting it out to the rest, start taking evasive maneuvers 

  

- what does talking about a desire look like: a goblin is jittery to cause mischeif, can choose weather or not to convey their idea, conveys to a few buddies, starts a mischief wave, until either enough people find the idea distasteful and the wave is quelled leaving a small minority interested, or everyone goes goblin mode

  

- Talking about a a particularly sick branch: 

- Goblin A: look at this branch, 
- Goblin B: omg!! secondhand wonder, sick fucking branch. 
- Goblin C: Branch possibly used for poking, 

*goblin B pokes goblin A with branch*

- Goblin A: ouch
- Goblin B and C: ouch (less severe)

  

Test

- Assesses your ability to move with a tide

- assesses your ability to come up with wacky ideas

- assesses your ability to get crafty 

- ideas

- obstacle course 

- stealing

[^1]: The limits of this power are constantly being enhanced but are pushed by {Seers} (name pending: deals with a monastery where people are pushing the boundaries on perception). maybe the telepathy spells do more????? [[Telepaths guild]]
[^2]: This isn't always true, the more disconnected you are with the network (maybe the connection is slower, allowing less regimented acquisition of knowledge) maybe, that has an influence on the control the {tree} has over your mind , maybe some people like on the outskirts
[^3]:  this could be a poor idea 
[^4]: This information is constantly updated and changed based on the perception of them by other beings. current perceptions of things are averaged in a way . However, A history of these changes and averages are also stored, [[mycelium]] become extremely dense around areas with a lot of history or cultural importance.
[^5]: What is and is not shared with ithers is complex,  all thoughts enter the [[mycelium|network]]  however they are encrypted, you generate the image you send out into the world, however this meshes with how you are perceived by others 
[^6]: [[Xylaan (entity)|god]] choses how you interpret the info maybe?
[^7]: this access is extremally important, without access you are completely cut off from the network 
[^8]:
