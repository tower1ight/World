Geography and Ecology 
- [[The Talons|Talons]] 
- Deadlands: an environment made by your kind, these secrets are known to many but should be gaurded at all costs, humans and their lot require, the land cracks and breaks apart, the land is subject to sporatic weather, harsh rains and fasy drying 
	- Primary sentient residents: Goblinoids, spiders, kobolds, 
	- Major organisms: null, hardy grass
	- 
	- 
 ## Reeds:
  Similar to something like a chaparral region, marked by foothills stepped in an ocean of tall grass, It should be noted that the [[mist layer]], supported by denser ares of the forest, does not reach the majority of this region. 
	- Primary sentient residents: Goblinoids, spiders, and 
	- Notable organisms: Tall grass (three varieties), parasite, bullete (eats grass )
	- Scenes:
		- Supple reed, lakeside, bugs skimming the surface 
		- The weeds 
		- delecacy to cook and eat the reeds like banboo stakls

 #### swaying, 
 above you is a dance, reeds tall enough to reach the mist syphoning uff sugar in big gulps, wroms wriggle in the mud and you look out on a lake, its stiller than one mi8ght imagine, the buffeting wind shielded by the tall grass. atonec a gust

A gust of wind pushed reeds in a dance, their green stalks bending together as though they moved in water, gentely schookling in one ddirectiom, then another. a four legged creature, with a bulbus abomin at its center scates across the muddy water,  light rain begins to move in, leaving dfdelicate drops acrosss the water, an eel moves slowly in the water a central fin snaking back and fort, give the appearance of stillness. and we zoom into its spine folloing its would be shoulder as is takes a deepers dive, sunned enough to be comrfortable. the lakes floor is clouded, movement kicking uop dirt and leaving an almost solid opaque cloud. the ssahelloed creatures obsqueres by the cloud crack their chells atgainst one another, Large shark like tails propel them at remarkabe speeds and air buble forms as the two clash heads again, 

 #### Ecology
 This area has always had less resouces, farther from the heart of xylaan than most other biomes, sugar trickles out into this ecosystem and the mist layer touches its outer edges, creatures in this place are on the smaller side, mega fauna is less prevalent
 - Goblins
	 - have domesticated spiders, not native to the area 
 - Hell pigs
 - Turkeys, hearding poultry 
	 - long claws and short flight ability 
 - long legg, stalk walkers 
 - Stalks: kind of like a cylindrical cellery straws, typically used for drawing in sugars from the mist layer. These have split into three different subspecies, green gold and white.
	 - Green stalks exist in high sugar area, (lakeside, and closer into the forest)
	 - Gold Stalks are the most prevalent,very resource efficient they 
	 - White Stalks, rigid and dry this species lives off of  dried and strips peel away


  






- licken peaks: A set of mountains that branch from the [[The Talons|Talons]] and wrap inward. in most palces this mountain range can be divided into three regions, foothills, lichen, and the icy parts. The concentrated sugar found in the [[mist layer]] and feeds lichen, bacteria, and other microorganisms that latch onto the side of the mountain. these die and build on themselves, creating rough structures and supporting a fascinating ecosystem. This lichen is packed with sugars so 
- desidious
	- primary sentient: 
	- Notable organism: dancing lady, Weeping Willow, rot angel, rot beast hears, ginat spiders, very traditional fantasy beasts 
- jungle: the jungle constitutes one of xylaans largest cities, it sits sollidly in the [[mist layer]] highly vertical. Being created by seraphs and the manufacturing site of almost all xylaani [[skiffs]], much of its traversal is done by flying, beneath 
- Under jungle:  the [[mist layer]], when combined with the tree density and height of the area, blocks out almost all light under the the jungle creating something of a deadzone, a ecosystem that feeds on seraphim refuse and what energy iit can leach from the mycelium, what is whale fall 
 ## Purelake:
  An enormous shallow lake, supports floating lilypads, highest biodiveristy
	- giant lungfish
	- stick bug predators
	- photosynthetic axolotle stegasaurus 
	- flag fish - wing fins
	- 

Long sticky legs break the surface of the waterm, they have held perfectly still for over an hour now, their owner holding unbreakable focus on the space below them, a brown smooth texture they are covered in moss and allge where they meet the surface of the water. Bellow a subtle chase occurs, an old barnacled shell drifts through the water, a shcool of transparent fish split and regroup behind its moving on, at onece athe turtle darts theough the roods of a massive mangrove and an eel its been pursuing for hours darts way, its slippery body kinking up alge and degraded wood as it slithereds through thick 






Your people are scientists ,


As a foundation the following is information that the common  alchemist would know, it is not all your people know or all you may be able to recal, but these are things that are repeated and talked of enough that you would know them innately. You would remember major events and their cultural impact, and if your background warrants it you may have lots of information on specific subjects, but most facts require rolls

alchemists are bio engineers, their role in the xylaani empire having been primarily on germ functionality, and materials development. While not responsible fore thier development, they 

small and 

GOblins are an underclass, smiths, material workers
