 # what is it

Things to consider
- how do hexes and organisms change seasonally
- what are life cycles, not just time but reproduction and life stages
- how do they use the [[mycelium|network]], how are they suffering in the wake of [[Xylaan retreat]]

## Flora
 #### Stalks: a couple biome sized organism
 Green Stalks 
 Yellow Stalks
 White Stalks 
Carnivourus one
 water sponge flower: part hydrange part pussywillow, these guys sit at the side of a water source and dip their head in to drink
planes fraun grass
 
#### Microorg
 Mold
 Mold (white variant)
 Lichen
 Floor moss: sustained by water that follows the stalk groves and is transfered from clouds the forest floor 
 Germ
 Aerogel tumbleweed
 
#### Trees and Shrubs
 Acacia 
 Floor Oak: a tangled mass of branches that sit about 8 feet wide and 5 feet tall, possessing thorned leaves a semi empty center, many small creatures call this home in turn leaving nutrients at the forest floor in their dens
 Siphon vines: snake up trees, fast growing to capitilize on gaps in the [[Ichor]]
 
#### Flowers
 Carnivourus one
 water sponge flower: part hydrange part pussywillow, these guys sit at the side of a water source and dip their head in to drink 


## Fauna 
 #### Mammals
 Bush mice: About the size of ones hand these critters are extremely social, highly connected they tend to move in concert schooling like fish and bustling in out of dens made in the Floor Oak, They have very thin back rear jointed legs 
 Hell Pig 
 
#### Invertebrates 
 Shell head
 isopod: herd (lots of detritus)
 
 #### Birds
 Wormer: A medium sized long necked bird, whose diet is primarily composed of stalk worms. Highly psionically sensitive they respond directly to stalk distress calls sent out when a parasite starts depriving a given stalk of sugar access
 
 #### Reptiles

 #### bugs
 Isopod mites: live between shell gaps eating their flesh and laying eggs 
 Stalk worms: about 1/2 inch long in their infancy they have sharp shreading teeth the allow them to burrow to the center of green and yellow stalks, once in a stalk they make their way to the top and grow barbs into the stalk walls dig their sides and grow to about 5 feet. they live by sucking [[Ichor]] out of the [[Ichor]] and ultimately depriving their host

## Plane and foothills
Whispy grass surround you, thick roots in the ground lets hundreds of fine frauns, they drift slowly with the with the wind, the earth is soft here, very dificult to run in. Steady flexible movements and psionic coordination allow those skilled in it to walk with it unhindered. Sad, you don't have that yet. you fall onto it learning that it will support your weight and in the same moment you are pulled beneath, staring a jungle of activity bellow, arachnids rest in burrows, a rodent like creature the size of a small dog digs throughs a large invertebrate, its claws tearing through thin skin on its underside.
