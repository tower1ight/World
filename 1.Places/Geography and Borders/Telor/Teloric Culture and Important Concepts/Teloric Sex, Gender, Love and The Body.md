### Sex and modesty
 - Dragons: because dragons are so tied to this culture, its worth understanding dragon reproduction
	 - Dragon do not reproduce sexually, they literally conceive of a child in their mind
	 - This is can happen with one dragon alone, can also happen with any number of other dragons. As long as they are able to conceptualize this child with perfect harmony and clarity of thought
	 - One can theoretically reproduce with a dragon, but this has never been recorded as linking your thought with a dragon is incredibly difficult if not impossible.
 - In this way, when lust is concerned, the emphasis on anatomy is significantly reduced in comparison to our culture
 - This deemphasis of anatomy is not to say the body is unimportant, but rather that the use of that body has so much more weight than the body itself. ie a tell would find the way one moves another's hips when dancing far more intimate than seeing their naked body 
### Gender
- Because of this deemphasis on anatomy, gender is much less associated with ones form,
- here is almost a form of craft in how one presents themselves, as a tell ages and gather new experience, learning more and more about they build and iterate on their identity and gender
### Love
- Connection to others is multifaceted in all cultures, sex is certainly a part of it romantic love, but as a whole sharing creation is essential to intimacy and love. Allowing others to watch you create and craft is a sign of trust, and allowing another to participate in your craft is even more special.
### The body
-   As most cultures, perception of ones body is complicated
-   Because so much of [[Telor|Teloric]] culture is about immortalization, you can imagine they hold a certain amount of contempt for something that so quickly decays and changes
-   However, because so much of their spirituality  is based in the act of creation, their bodies are the instruments they use to touch god. There is a certain amount of love one has for their paintbrush.
-   As you can imagine aging has even more complexity, as it is often correlated with extreme mastery of craft, yet equally a reminder that that person, their knowledge, and their skill will be gone some.
