a focal council is the basis for Local Gov in [[Telor]] (rules have leeway as town population shrinks)
 ### Leaders
- Generally there are 4 positions of power in a given town, each serve a community role and acts as focalist priests
	- [Focal] leader (Focal): Primary community leader, in charge of creating laws, settling local disputes, organizing civic projects and government funding, ensuring tax collection. Aided by the guide, archivist, and captain in organizing the town. 
	- Guiding scholar (Guide): Primary point of contact for most citizens in their personal worship, acting as a mentor. In charge of organizing resources for community workshops, kind of a work therapist. Shares some of the teaching responsibilities of the archivist.
	- Archival scholar (Archivist): Ensures the education and documentation of the town, aids with personal research, maintains and manages the towns library. Shares some of the personal passion aid responsibilities of the guide 
	- Leader of local militia (Captain): Organizes and maintains the towns militia to protect them from any outside threats and enforce the thrones laws. Often aid the the focal leader in settling local disputes.
- All civic work generally is run out of the local focalist church
- Power dynamics will vary from town to town

 ### Leader selection and indoctrination
- Because travel is so fast, cheap, and emphasized for the progression of ones craft, civic training is handled both as mentorship under the previous leader and formal training in government organizations
- When the two scholars deem the timing right they will select five adolescents and send them to the violet church for training.
- The five will make a pilgrimage to the violet church and train there for several years, a year or so into study they will choose amongst themselves which path is appropriate for each of them (often this choice is influenced by the scholars at the violet church) and continue their studies with concentration on their chosen subject
	- One will become a focal leader (often potent mages)
	- One will become a guiding scholar
	- One  will become a archival scholar
	- Two will remain in the amethyst city for further training
- At the same time that the 5 are sent to the violet church, the captain will send three or more adolescents to train with the teloric military, of which one will return as an aspiring captain.
- Before a focal and a captain return home they meet at the capital, forming a Focal Pair, and are sent to travel together for a year or so.
	- Focal pairs from more significant towns will travel abroad, and are often given a larger task or mission
