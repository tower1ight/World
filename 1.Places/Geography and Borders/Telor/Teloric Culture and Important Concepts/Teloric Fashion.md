Fabric
- The lighter (weight) and more colorful/patterned a piece of fabric can be, the better
- Pleats, gathers anything to emphasize movement

Structure
- Marks of craftsmanship such as tailoring are valued, things that fit like a glove are cool
- any working person's garment will be cut or pinned close to the body to not get caught
- high fashion is high fashion though, and tassels and trailing bits are in style

Bits and Bobs
- ALL OF THEM
- glittery bits, little chimes or bells, beads that refract light
- Special emphasis on the gemstones as they are especially relevant to [[draconic mark|draconic lineage]] and its cultural importance
