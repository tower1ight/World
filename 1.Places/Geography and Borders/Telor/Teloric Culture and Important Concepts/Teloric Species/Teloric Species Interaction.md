Population dynamics
-   In [[Telor]] its not exactly kumbaya, because no matter how you spin it, one species relationship with another will be complex. Each group will have preconceived notions of the others and as a result oversimplify and misinterpret each others values and traditions. However, generally speaking because populations have had a lot of time to drift, racial stress exists, but is generally a secondary or tertiary aspect of a given conflict

[[Humans|Humans]], [[Halflings|Halflings]], [[Gnomes|Gnomes]]
-   Majority represented race 
-   Have a history of war with elves 

[[Elves|Elves]]
-   Reside primarily in the swamps of [[Hythriel]] or the [glade]
-   Have a history of war with humans, halflings, and gnomes
	-   Given their lifespan they are much more angry about it

[[Dwarves|Dwarves]]
-   High population of dwarfs live and work in [[Allyol]]
-   Great with engineering and automation

[[Dragonborn|Dragonborn]]
-   Dragonborn are not descended from dragons, (though dragons can create a child that looks like a dragonborn they are entirely different)
	-  Created 673 years ago by a Voral King attempting to create a draconic heir by the sorcery of their draconic mark
	-   Mechanically the same as a 5e Dragonborn
- Revered by [[Focalism|focalists]]
	- Often in a really weird way
	- Can get kinda creepy as they are obsessed with draconic bloodlines
- To [[Pages of the Library|pages]] and [[Cult of the Library|cultists]] dragonborn are a reminder of everything their religion despises
	- As sorcery gone awry, they will see them as creatures to be pitied as well as abominations

[[Warforged|Warforged]] 
-   Warforged were found wandering the deeper depths of the [[The Great Library|Library]]
-   All memories reset when knowledge of the [[The Great Library|Library]] disappeared
-   Generally revered for their ability to house information, though this can often lead to the warforged being used as servants storing information
- 
Animal and “enemy” creatures: Not super common or popular but people do their best to be chill if you aren't hostile. Their best can leave something to be desired, if they don't desire you directly ;)
-   Planar entities, changelings, and all the rest: Very very uncommon, who tf knows how people will react to you,
