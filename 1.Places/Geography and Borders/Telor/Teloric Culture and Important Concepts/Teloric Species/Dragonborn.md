 ## [[Telor|Teloric]]  Dragonborn
 -   Dragonborn are not descended from dragons, (though dragons can create a child that looks like a dragonborn they are entirely different)
	-  Created 673 years ago by a Voral King attempting to create a draconic heir by the sorcery of their draconic mark
	-   Mechanically the same as a 5e Dragonborn
- Revered by [[Focalism|focalists]]
	- Often in a really weird way
	- Can get kinda creepy as they are obsessed with draconic bloodlines
- To [[Pages of the Library|pages]] and [[Cult of the Library|cultists]] dragonborn are a reminder of everything their religion despises
	- As sorcery gone awry, they will see them as creatures to be pitied as well as abominations
