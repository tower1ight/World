up:  [[The Great Library]]

At its core librarian theology states that discovery is a violent and invasive process, a balance must be struck between creation and caution.  One should care as much (if not more) for consequences a creation poses as they do for the creation itself.

Once the people of the world were able to learn without abusing the world around them, It was said that the library would reveal itself in Ernest.

#### [[The War of the Gates]]
After the War, in which [[Tel'Voric]] informed the [[Telor|Tels]] of the [[The Great Library|Library]] [[Gate]], [[Elves|Hythrielen Elves]] and [[Teloric Species Interaction|the species of Telor]], despite animosity, were now more integrated and began to share their respective religions allowing worship of the library to spread beyond [[Hythriel|the_Glade]] 
-  Due to the institutional prevalence of [[Focalism]], followers of the library are not welcomed but do exist in pockets of Telor.

#### [[The Erasure]]
After the gates to the the library disappeared, its culture of worship splintered as many have differing opinions on the cause of its disappearance
-   [[Pages of the Library|The Pages of the Library]]: Those who still call themselves pages believe that [[Tel'Voric]] was at the very least involved with the [[The Great Library|Library's]] closure, if not its source entirely. For this reason they see no reason to change their faith and responsibilities as Pages and thus still believe that if their work is done and the globe is prepared for the knowledge within, the library will destroy [[Tel'Voric|Tel'Voric's]] grip on it and reemerge.
	-  as a result there is a lot of animosity between [[Pages of the Library|pages]] and [[Focalism|focalists]] 
- Others believe that [[Tel'Voric]] was only tangentially involved as the [[The Great Library|Library]] closed its doors entirely voluntarily. Deciding to reevaluate those who it deems responsible enough for access through its [[Gate|gates]] in response to the destruction of the [[Amethyst City]]  and taint of a large portion of [[Hythriel]] by Queen Aloric [[Voral Dynasty|Voral]] in the [[False Ascension]].  This belief created a splinter of the [[Pages of the Library|pages]] known as the [[Cult of the Library]]
