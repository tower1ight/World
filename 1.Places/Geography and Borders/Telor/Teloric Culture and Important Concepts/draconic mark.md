The draconic mark is a poon granted by [[Tel'Voric]] to Gael [[Voral Dynasty|Voral]] that gave her tremendous [[Magic|magical]] ability in the form of draconic sorcery. It manifests as a crystalized draconic sigil burned into the space between ones collarbone that becomes more and more transparent the less one is connected to it.

This boon is capable of passing through bloodlines, allowing the [[Voral Dynasty|Voral]] family to be such potent sorcerers and gain so much political favor. This ultimately became embedded in [[Telor|Teloric]] culture, providing large emphasis on lineage

The[[Voral Dynasty]] ended up losing grasp on the draconic bloodline, allowing its potency to be reduced due to several heirs chosen for political prowess over [[Magic|magical]] ability.

At the time of [[Campaign IV]],[[Marge Vaginopolis]] is the closest living person to the mark and as a result is the most potent sorcerer in the [[Voral Dynasty|Voral]] bloodline.

This mark is a particularly relevant icon to [[Focalism]]
