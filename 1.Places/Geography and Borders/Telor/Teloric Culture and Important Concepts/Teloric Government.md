The [[Telor|Teloric]] political system is built on a dense and complicated hierarchy. Here are the key points 
- The throne is the central point of rule that branches both into two groups: The [[Violet Church]], and the [[Teloric military]]
- [[Focalism]]is inherently tied with the government as [[Tel'Voric]] is the basis for the countries origin and claim to unity
- The chain of bureaucracy throughout the land generally goes from towns> surrounding province> violet church> throne 


 # Local Government or [[focal council]]
(rules have leeway as town population shrinks)
Generally there are 4 positions of power in a given town, each serve a community role and acts as [[Focalism|focalist]] priests
-   [[Focal leader]] (Focal): Primary community leader, in charge of creating laws, settling local disputes, organizing civic projects and government funding, ensuring tax collection. Aided by the guide, archivist, and captain in organizing the town. 
-   Guiding scholar (Guide): Primary point of contact for most citizens in their personal worship, acting as a mentor. In charge of organizing resources for community workshops, kind of a work therapist. Shares some of the teaching responsibilities of the archivist.
-   Archival scholar (Archivist): Ensures the education and documentation of the town, aids with personal research, maintains and manages the towns library. Shares some of the personal passion aid responsibilities of the guide 
-   Leader of local militia (Captain): Organizes and maintains the towns militia to protect them from any outside threats and enforce the thrones laws. Often aid the the focal leader in settling local disputes.

All civic work generally is run out of the local [[Focalism|focalist]] church and power dynamics will vary from town to town. 

 ## Leader selection and indoctrination
- Because travel is so fast, cheap, and emphasized for the progression of ones craft, civic training is handled both as mentorship under the previous leader and formal training in government organizations
- When the two scholars deem the timing right they will select five adolescents and send them to the violet church for training.
- The five will make a pilgrimage to the violet church and train there for several years, a year or so into study they will choose amongst themselves which path is appropriate for each of them (often this choice is influenced by the scholars at the violet church) and continue their studies with concentration on their chosen subject
	- One will become a focal leader (often potent mages)
	- One will become a guiding scholar
	- One will become a archival scholar
	- Two will remain in the amethyst city for further training
- At the same time that the 5 are sent to the violet church, the captain will send three or more adolescents to train with the teloric military, of which one will return as an aspiring captain.
- Before a focal leader and a captain return home they meet at the capital, forming a Focal Pair, and are sent to travel together for a year or so.
	- Focal pairs from more significant towns will travel abroad, and are often given a larger task or missio

 # Nobility
- Due to the ease of communication and travel, nobel houses function almost like companies with more codified rules of lineage and family ownership 
- These houses sponsor and run design collectives, profiting off of the crafts and goods their members make 
- The most prestigious houses have old ties to the voral dynasty
-  The houses are all really diversified, specifically the big houses, most listed here will pursue wide varieties of work (art, literature, fashion, history, agriculture, weapons, furniture. However most of the big houses have a specialty or creative focus that influences all of their work. 
- Houses are also diversified in terms of location, most have a primary city location and practice, but all listed here will have work and 
- Notable large houses :
	- [[House Follanel]] (in [[Vorvelal]])
		- works specifically in materials: textiles, jewelry, metallurgy and smithing techniques, high fashion  structural design and architecture, natural sciences
		- Other pursuits and large volume products: building materials, hides, meat, agriculture, chemicals, medicinal products
		- due to its focus on raw materials, this house probably has the most physical presence in telor, organizing large projects in logging, mining, agriculture, biology (specifically plant biology), and  materials and synthetic chemistry.
	- [[House Yeitel]] (in [[Allyol]])
		- Brand is focused on artificing and physical sciences: magic infused clothing (glamour attached to clothing, making interesting garment structural design, etc), magical and nonmagical gadgets and accessories, heavy focus on physics, mathematics, chemistry, geology 
		- Other pursuits and large volume products: makes up a large part of the spell components market, creates so many non industrial magic items, lots of non magic everyday devices
		- Strong ties and relationships with the [[Engineers Guild]]
	- [[House Kahdar]] (in [[Vorvelal]])
		- Focus on literature, art, sculpture,  history, theology
		- Other pursuits and large volume products: popular source of information and reporting (the violet church and the throne put out “official” reports on news, policy, current events, culture etc, and these are broadly respected by teloric citizens. However, House Kahdar is significantly more culturally relevant,  is respected as a valuable source of information, but its popular because its significantly more entertaining, and often has altogether better reporting and contextualizes its content through both historical and narrative lenses)
		- Connected with [[The Ascendant Halls]] and thus the arts and theory of devine magic
		    
- Many other houses exist and are integral to the Teloric economy with varying reputations and levels of acclaim, these three are particularly relevant right now but are frequently met with strong competition and the tides change somewhat quickly
