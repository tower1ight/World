The built environment in Telor is founded in simultaneous innovation and preservation
 # Personal space

- All people build, tinker, and play. The [[Telor|Teloric]] people just have no qualms about boasting it, and as a result their creations litter the walls: 
	- A tailor hangs their recent sketchbook in a perfectly arrayed set of black frames. Mundane scribbles and calculations of no particular importance sit adjacent to an exquisitely rendered sewing pattern. 
	- Hanging on pegs next to several book shelves of rolled  maps, are a set of four and a half iterations of a strange transportation device. Unable to and uninterested in banishing this terrible idea from their mind, a middle aged courier has attached a wooden shaft to spring in the hopes of bouncing around town at maximum speed.
- As faith to a [[Focalism|focalist]] is sought through discovery and concentration, ones place of creation and [[focus|meditation]] is holy. Almost all homes have a space for each resident that is unique to them. These can range from entire workshops to broom closets. Regardless of size or equipment these places are sacred.
	- Those who travel will often take something integral to the space with them that allows or helps them to be close to the space. This can be a tool, or a notebook, a collapsible chair, a rug, etc
	- Sometimes these spaces are shared or even built to be shared, needless to say this is an extremely intimate experience and should not be taken lightly.
	- This space is not always in a home, it could be in an entirely different building, many of these places are available within focalist churches
 # Large buildings and institutions
 
- The [[Telor|Teloric]] people see  structures as marks of their history, and documentation of the past. However that does not stop them from iterating on them quite frequently. It is important that I note that this is (ideally) not seen as improvement but addition. At best, old buildings can hold unfathomable depth. Each layer working in harmony with the last, acting as architectural libations, adding context and to the additions that follow. At worst, however, buildings can appear grotesque, forming strange uncomfortable shapes made of clashing and poorly cared for materials. Over time if people lose interest in reinventing or working on them they corrode and rot, morphing into deflated unloved heaps.

 # Civic planning
- It is a custom of these people that buildings are very rarely destroyed unless it is absolutely necessary. So said unloved heaps tend to collect, and over large swaths of time end up morphing the topography of a town or city. 
	- If it is absolutely necessary to destroy a structure, meticulous documentations is underwent by the focalist church. Ultimately creating a volume of what can be gleaned of the buildings history and the specifications of the building including building materials, techniques, and many detailed sketches.
- Towns and cities don't have a given or codified way to account for heaps of rotting building materials. Some choose to embrace sprawl, setting the city borders as ambiguous and flexible to account for future growth. Some set very clear and firm boundaries on building, choosing to grow vertically and allowing structures to naturally coalesce and separate as time goes on. Consequently creating a labyrinth of streets, bridges and tunnels. Most find something in the middle of these two extremes.
