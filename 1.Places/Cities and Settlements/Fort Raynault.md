These grates connect to a larger scaffolding network from which chains hang, some holding massive engine blocks. Some 40 dwarves work here,  hammers clink, pipes whistle, they somehow work in concert
	- The workshop can be divided into train manufacturing and maintenance, smithy and arti
	- **Jort Gundrick** is the primary overseer, serving as the primary representative for the engineers guild he is loud, proud, and very aware of telors inability to function without his team or knowledge, something he is very aware of and keen on protecting, any request for information about dwarven technology will shut him down. loosened with alcohol and a lover of decadent food, you can but his attention but hell sober as soon as his dwarven loyalty is in question, he is aware of his staffs schemes but has his hands full fulfilling [[Telor|Telor's]] requests and managing the shop

 ### Underground
 - A decree from [[Sage Aelon]] restricted access, declaring that those not authorized to travel the passageways would be punished, this has made a large surveying operation impossible. This was a large point of contention between Sage Aelon and general raynault as a system of unexplored caves is indefensible. This has however not kept the underground from being explored 
	 - Dwarves explorin its their nature 
- What was it? originally alchemist territory pre [[disconnect]] and is later utilized by them to implant a psionic blocker and perform maintenance, as it is currently active this is a sort of inert location of the underway

	- Sage aelon has scouts looking 
	- dwarves know of it
	- cultists know
