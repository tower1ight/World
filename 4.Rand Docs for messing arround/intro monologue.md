lioght bl;asts intop the open windows aof your tran illumiating your fellow inmateas and cASTING YOUR SHADDOW AGAINST THE BACK WAL. yuour eyes meet a wall, of fog and foliage, tall grass like small treed in the distance forming an unatural break with a field of dirt an dmud. a light sprinkle of rain is comming down and obscuring your vission but through the fog you can glimpse something that is able to break trhough the grass, something briliatly collored letting off pinks and yellows
