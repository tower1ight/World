bebo bebo bebo
Lets finish this up im ready to get the fuck out of here, im sick of loosing my footing, 
 yeah *crackly earth* , ursla side eye, thats the problem 
\


what futile public works project are they on about 

Big capital building, 
- not gardens, because they are part of nature, they dont consider their world to be unnatural, xylaan is at the center of this city and therefore so is nature
- built into a mud structure with perfectly technological fitting, its not as though they have constructed a material to suit their needs,
- what they need is available in the world and the earth
- clay walls are filled with xylaans being, with other spores, some strudy plants burrow into it, this is changeable. 
- what is the city doing with permanent materials,
	- permanent materials are [[mold]]
	- It lends itslef to concrete, something that your [[Telor]] doesnt have 
	- Different leaves or forest textures are used for stylistic purposes
	- im envisioning geometric pillars, think governors island but with the scavengers reign plus sign creatures 
	- multitiered like a pagoda, but cappable of spacial separation with a series of elegantly placed curved staircases
- Partially finished, mayor is overseeing the project, architects manage the executuion


What is the mayor like, salvuchi meets robert mozes

an idealist that is driving their people to liberation but is unmoving and ruthless, he will get what he wants, he is the power broaker 

How does the power broaker deal with being disempowered
stubornly, unmovingly.

Shove that letter up your ass, you slime, you wretched little creature, put that helmet on or I will personally throw you off this wall

It is not simply fending for ourself, we commit treason, they have glut themselfs on xylaans body, we will not them them glut themselves on ours 

Xylaan has four aspects, body, hands-builder, stomach-giver, mind-teacher



what is the built environement like

yes roads and walls have practical uses and the goblins are smart enough to use them, take the thread and pull on it 
what does having growable concrete mean, concrete scientists, equal parts engineer, chemist, biologist 

Keeping goblins focused is imperative, they will plot against the project lead and the thing wont be completed 

The philosophy of building is fueled by manic hyperfixation, so many large well executed structures make up their spaces, the more goblins, the bigger and grander the structures. Often these structrues have a religious aspect to them, works are made in service to the mighty builder and as an exercise of emulating the design. the division between nature and them is a foreign concept, they are part of the nature like xylaan is a part of them, they are acutely aware of violence and will use it, they bear feirce grudges and will be cruel, but they dont fear bugs, bug are not a threat to them, unless they are in which they will be swiftly put down


the concrete can be grafted, its pruned like a tree, shaped like a mellon 
big fuck off leaf deigns 
crystallized fungus acts like power outlets for the [[mycelium]]
seemless design, or rather the seams of the organism 
long upord curves
used for important infrastruture,
most of it is made of manufactured sheets and materials

they have mythical refining procesee, fey sorcery
Magic is very present, low level psionic are widespread and ingrained in communication. very few but the [[The Entangled|Seers]] have the technical ability or capacity for more powerful and self driven psionic powers


What do we know so far, 
goblins speak a language that allows them to perfectly synchronize, communicating and acting as if 
They have hoards across xyalaan,


ok life update:e

I miss you to <3 !!!



Not like a ton has changed since we last saw eachother, here are the big ones:

Tattoo is huge, literally couldn't be happier about tattoo, radically positive body modification, next appointment in a week ahhhhhhhhhh

On a quest for new medication, pursuing new adhd drugs because Im at my fucking limit in that regard, also pursuing hrt woot woot!!

Having a little bit of trouble focusing on writing, drawing, designing, see med quest and the post I put in our DND discord. Its always difficult to feel burnt out and not really be doing that much of anything. Like burnt out from what sitting on my couch playing pokemon???????????? just let me follow through on a single creative idea. ANYWAY I am very excited for what lies ahead (stuff ive been thinking about for literally six years now), its just not where I want it to be right now. Having a deadline be months out always helps me start actually enjoying the process of putting things on the page so i think my mood will improve in this respect.

Been consuming a lot of building and public works content, 99pi's powerbroker recap (recap of *The Power Broaker*, biography of Robert Moses and his impact on new york and public works in general, julias mother showed us this and we have gotten hooked), 99pi's not built for this (short podcast about our biggest infrastructure challenges with climate change), the great bridge (started this one a while ago and im trying to finish it now, book detailing the construction of the brooklyn bridge), the big dig (a podcast about the titular project, one of the largest and most expensive public works in the history of the US, breathed life into boston, also haunted the city for 30+ years)

Also just finished my second watch of scavengers reign with julia its literally sooooo good
