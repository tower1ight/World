 # what is the core of pearls vibe
 - pulled between powers 
 - librarians
 - 1. so pearl is a sacrifice/pawn/emissary in the game of tug of war between the realms
    
    so she wouldn't be cursed due to internal fey politics, but probably as some sort of safeguard... but I can't think of how/why
    
1. I have come up with a subclass.
    
    I don't think it's too busted

    (mostly because it just robs from a couple other subclasses)
    z
    at 1st level: -expanded spell list just like divine soul, but druid instead of cleric -expertise in a charisma based skill (this is the only one I added myself and therefore is a little op i think, but not unheard of!)
    
	 6th level and above: -just shift the bard college of glamor abilities down a level. so for 6th level you get the 3rd level abilites, for 11th level you get the 6th level... etc.
    z
    tbh I think this is actually more balanced than divine soul hahahaha
    
    and it makes sense for my beloved pearl


sorcerer: full caster, tools for battle utility and increased spell power
druid list, especially class and fey relevent (maybe play with the druid list)

Infused 

Arcane Fey
(  1 ) Druidic magic.                    B
(  1 ) Fey Affinities                      A
(  2 ) expertise (charisma)           S
(  6 ) enthralling performance.  A 
( 14 ) Mantle of majesty             A  (at 3rd level)
( 18 ) Unbreakable majesty        B





divine soul
divine magic                        S
divine affinities                   A
favored by gods                   A
empowered healing            B-
angelic form                         A
unearthly recovery              C

is not uniquely sorcerer they have a built in resource 
more sorcery points = more fun









 
 
 
generally speaking pearl is essentially a bargaining chip between [[Tel'Voric]] and the feywild

claimed both realms, one by blood and ceremony, another by power

they made a treatey and hold her as the binding vessel of the agreement, people can store energy like batteries, increaing their capacity to focus


it is agrees that she was to be monitored by both

she is pulled beecause telvorc needs her 

still a sorcerer


bard like sorcerer
