abandoned goblin village council 
crossing the threshold of the dome you feel a warmth flow through your body, light pours in from a central skylight and illuminates the earth beneath you. There is something tingling in your spine, something unfamiliar to you yet so profoundly whole, this is a meeting place, maybe a home ofr a community gathering place but lived in all the same. as you walk further in, the loose dirt starts becoming slightly more compact. not just compact but rough. as you put your hand to the ground you ccan feel somehting just below the surface


something pale is left beind and the dirt files into the ridges of whateverr this is. plae comes back to you lifeless, and a longing fills you that you can almost deem natural. you trace a finger allong one of these ridges and find that it has a direction. The gap resting beneath your finger grows smaller as you trace your way to the room's center. in return for finding a center of whatever this is you recieve a small jolt of paibnt and look down to see blood, hard and porus this thing has torn through a layer of your skin and the marks of blood youve left behind seem vibrant in comparison to the dull whites and greys of it. Youve fallen just short of this structures center and see a softened circle where your finger might have traced

electrical signals ripple up and down your spine but end just short of your neck, set adrift in your nervous system. you feel the pang of unsatisfied anticipation, a note held to long and a reach for something you know shoud fill you. but ... the moment ends, the pit within you grows slightly wider lays dormant for the moment

The kings eyes sag and drift lazily to you. In a silent gesture he raises his goblet in your direction, letting some of the elven wine spill out onto the floor,  at ounce 3 salt goblins dash top the base of his throne fighting to lick the floor beneath him

"we thank you for this gracious feast , we hope your stay is as comfortable as we can make it, you have but to ask and we will grant your wish, so long as we can spare it"  jsjsjsjsjjsjsjs
