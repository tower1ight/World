Sitting in the chair is someone short, slightly copperish of skin with curly hair and a thick beard, wearing a tight and starched officers uniform, that chaffes at thier neck, the feirbolg looks at you and 

Sage Aelon sent off a runner with the message, Sircha, Kai, and Yenora, wherever that inconvenient hunk of metal was hiding, would know its conent within the hour, but she had no qualms, letting them puzzle this one out. She would be free of this infantile plotting soo. she didnt know how kai did this every day. A stack of sending scrolls layed out in front of her, It was a wonder how many she saent or how irrelevant their cost had become, If not powerful, uncommon magic, though false modesty was a tool until you started using it without intention, there was a time that purchasing an uncommon scroll would have been impossible, but she had never felt empty coffers when she reaching for the power. When she asked it answered in droves, and she could feel it! The thoughts that constituted everything, the flow smoothing over her skin, trickling up her spine. It had been so long without a peer in that aspect. Something felt close though, it felt easier to be alone with that feeling than it used to.

Thoughts of soul and loneliness let her mind drift to marge yet agian. That woman that woman that woman, never would she meet her equal, she had certainly no longer become an option, 

She used to melt thinking about her, purpose, cruelty and power were her parts, they constituted every movement and every word, She could still find controll slipping when she thought of her but lonely and bitter thoughts clouded those memories. She said she would make them pay and she did, there was little that would not bend to marges will, but in the asking marge bent as well, Aelon knew where that purpose and cruelty and power had been directed and she feared. Yes she was jealous, yes she felt small knowing marge would not let her help, But under it all sage aelon still burned with devotion and knew that the godhood marge sought would be her end. Dragon Marked she may be, but telvoric would grind her in crystalline claws if she were not checked.

She remembered their night after marges coronation, ----  good sex
Its not that she wanted to be her queen, when she got reserved about her reserach that had hurt 
when hurt even more was seeing that it didnt matter that aelon wasnt sharing hers
dreams of thier lab fell short when they no longer shared work and their communal prayer rendered hollow 





her whole pursuit here was for that accursed woman. Things were actually running smoothly and d

and it felt so strange to be around kai again, a hateful man with a tenth of her might but formidle 




god i hate this this used to be me and sophie time :(



What they would have known,
the forest is made up of these stalk like things 


you've gotten close before but its strange, maybe your mind was filling in blanks but the wall like treeline youve seen before doesnt look like anything you are familiar with. For starters you see no cannopy or all that much outward growth for that matter, It looks as nothing you have seen before, the wall of forest ultimatly resolving into perfects sets of parallel lines. Finally able to separate the pattern into something you can understand lines join each-other and you can see that each bellongs to something like a trunk, reaching high into the air, the lines on these shoots appear to be deep grooves in a straw like bark, a sets of which litter the earth beneath them. About 4 feet in diameter and each spaced between 10 and 20 feet apart the trunks seem to go on forever. in the distance something furry scuttles under the bark debris



That same overwhelmed queasiness you got when you first arrived you, the kind that knocked you out, the feeling you have gotten every time youve looked at this tree line for the past three months 



about 100 ft 




It looks as though you were approaching a feild a of tree trunks stripped of branches and untappered, what a silly analogy

"something scuttles across the floor, its a horseshoe crab yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"



What is it like to drink blood, its like this mwah ha ha


Sitting under the tree aelon grinned, elated by the wonder of life and what she might do now that hers had flipped on a dime. she saw the world ahead of her with more clarity and certainty than she had ever known, hytherian throne would pay and blood drip down the stones of palace walls, her people would see her truly, terrible grace and cruelty would mark her as their own, Aelon glanced at the princess, and she looked up, caught engaing in the same fantasy, both of their smiles tight and betraying sinister deeds.  These humans were so strange, she had always been told that their lives were dull things, so stunted by mortality that their power lay in aggregate, this one simply glowed, she was dragon fire, she had, in one moment uprooted aelon from the context of an entire life, a knot woven with decades of scheming and court politics sliced with precesion, and now aelon was hers, on a path of her making. 

"When did you know that it was over"
Marge paused, taking a breath and giving some time to emphasize the gravity of the question
"Dinner ...  , i was at dinner with the princess, And I did not 'know"'
Another pause, long one too, but aelon leaned in indulging an marges indulgent pension for drama
Now she was brilliant, high focus capacity, good arcane theory, a she was a voral, she was ridgid though, and with telors queen and greatest minds having just been vaporized," illusuary vapor curled through her finger as she pantomimed the cataclysm" and with the monarch and what her brilliance stood for being upheaved what was she to do. She knew yondal was planning something, but she had taken a calculated risk, spent her tyranny elsewhere, and sorely misjudged dear friends"
Marge grew solemn, shadows in her features growing soft and deep 
I sat across from her, a cousin and a student, marveling at her placidity and dreaming to act with her conviction. So I acted, I found a girl to take my place and made off. I placed my confidence in the certainty that I had nothing to gain from putting faith in chance, I was not bound like she was
