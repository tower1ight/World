 # what is it


 
 
 
anxious anxious for resolve for unity for drive for love for movement for killing. Hair at the back of my neck, something is wrong, fucking gorthal and her fucking mice, why cant she just leave them alone.

sweet, as right as anything. waves ripple through me urges to drink, urges to dance, urges to kill, all strong. Smoothed too, a rapid current yes, but a certain one.  Curling my lip And showing my teeth to balthal across the table i send him the thought of a fight, rising to  meet me 


what does an argument look like, 

Anxiety at dueling objectives, semi manageable urge to resolve the conflict as soon as possible 
Tension tension tension at people holding themselves back, killing is wayu easieire than diplomacy, 

The others will agree to suspend their desires so long as Balthal can demonstrate their success as a sovereign people'
- hidden criteria:  consistant line of supplies and the ability tio defend themselves  s

discussions have just beeen resolvingn in fights and skirmishes
need to lock these fuckers in a rooma and make a decisions 

what do they wear, nothing 
what do they celebrate: propagation rituals 
what do they produce: materials, excelent coordianation at building something as a cohesive unit, the other factions would fuckign crumble if tthey had to build without them


fragreance
