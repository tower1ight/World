 # Abandoned town

At the center of the town lies a tower, its top seemingly held by spit and twin head szed bricks have been disloged by the passage of time and the thinning mortae. gaping holes in the buuildings roof have been left behind by said falling stiones, 

the building itself holds its shape well, before it was forgotten it had not grown old enough to acquire the familiar stacked and smashed look that old focalist buildings can acquire 
Its entrance faces the forest, the town almost parting, opening its doors and welcoming. That welcome left when the town did and you are left with an unnatural quiet filling you with unease


As you pass the threshold you imagine whoever used to live here, any evidence of a home is gone , moth eaten curtains and long forgotten animal nests tell you that this place has been vacant for at least a decade.  most personal belongings have been stripped from it, though it would be hard to tell weather bandidt s ofr the original residents you find that even pots and pans are missing,

It does not feel like a rushed departure

 you know what a focalist church should feel like, yiou should cross the thrshold and feell the warmth and smeell of old books, and wood. you should turn your head and see your guide in an alcove surrounded by the little ones. You know that wouldnt be found here and that in its place youd be met with horrors, sacred knowledge soiled by water and time, the towns records and archive left to ruin.  When  you step inside however you see none of that, where you expected bookshelvves and reading benches there is a cavernous room, marked by rows of pews facing a stage marked with a ten foot stone arch built into its center

Carved deep into it are two delicate trees branching into elvish script
