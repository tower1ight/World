**What are we doing here**
Travel in this place is disorienting, difficult, and above all uncertain. Any drama gained from running down to your last piece of hardtack relies on a consistent and predictable environment. For this reason I have chosen to avoid as much minutia as possible. I have deliberately avoided giving distance values to hexes and unless I tell you otherwise no ration tracking will be necessary.
# Rhythm, Phases, and Actions
#### Phases
Each Day has 3 Phases:
- Morning: Sunrise to Noon.
- Afternoon: Noon to Sunset.
- Night: Sunset to Sunrise.

 When ending a phase in a wilderness hex, a roll will made by the GM determining if the party provokes no encounter, makes contact with any landmarks that could be found in the given hex, or stumbles upon an omen to something greater.

#### Resting, Navigation, Committing to the Second World:

The forest is a dangerous place, a draining place, you are an alien here and an ecosystem you are not adapted to presses on your mind. When resting in the wilderness, the preparation time required for a long rest will result in the benefits of a short rest. A short rest will allow you to catch your breath, get a lay of the land, do any planning you might need, but it will not provide the benefits of a typical short rest.

If the party is able to find shelter or sanctuary, both short and long rests regain typical. However, access to shelter is precious and often comes at a cost. Finding where it is in the first place requires either stumbling upon it or relying on the help of others. A handful of locations can be learned directly and added to the map but for most things, if you want to get there pull over and ask for directions

# Landmarks and Myths
#### Landmarks
- **Dwellings:** Homes built in the wilderness, possibly a safe refuge if the owners can find a way to trust you (something contingent on your reputation). However, all things come at a cost, leaving without paying your dues harbors ill will, word travels. **Long rest permitted with the blessing of the owner**
- **Sanctuaries:**  Home to the seers, these groves are nodes of power in the mycelium **Long rest permitted to those who have had an audience with the seer**
- **Monuments:** preserved moments embedded in the mycelium, visions of the past and the future, conjured as possibilities, if one is a very skilled walking among the likes of [[The Entangled|Seers]], they might be able to discern stylistic history **Permits a Long Rest**
- **Hazards:** Nothing good can come from this, Xylaan is a violent place and your stumbling has roused something that ought to have stayed asleep
- **Curses:** You walk in strange teritorry, shifting trees and thick fog leave you confused you are **Blinded**
- **Ruins:** Forgotten things blend back into xylaan, everything returns to xylaan
#### Myths
- Myths represent the movement and change of living world, rarely pertinent to your main objective, they are something to seek out
