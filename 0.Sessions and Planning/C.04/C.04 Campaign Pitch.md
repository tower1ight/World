![[Teloric Map.png|300]]

- "this is an old iteration of my map so there are a few names and minor discrepancies "
- Sandwiched between the sea and the talons is a land that the people of telor call the [[ammolite veil]]
- Few know why and no humanoid alive knows when, but long ago it was shut out from the rest of the world 
- What you, julia, will, bea, gloria, saw at the end of the warm up arc was the prismatic wall being broken, allowing for free travel into and out of the land
- The framing of the campaign is that telor has tunneled through the talons and invaded the veil
- your party are part of a second wave of this invasion, joining the teloric governments outpost
- This second wave has been brought in by the violet church as the military presence there has been unable to make significant progress at exploring or understanding much of anything about the land and its geography 
- You are ostensibly a group of expendable prisoners used explore a strange and dangerous land, though it is a pretty thinly veiled attempt for most people with a steak in the veil to smuggle whatever and whoever they want in
 
 # Themes
 - What do you want to get from this

	 - how long, multi year or something wrappable 
 - not a hex crawler but Exploration and steaks through logistics (time, resources, distance)
 -

 - High contrast, low grit
