 # Omens
 1. Evidence of the first march: 
	 1. impressions in the ground (depending on area)
	 2. Struck by a desire to wither in the ground and sink into the floor around it, your emotions ask you to stop and despair 
	 3. a grouping of dead soliders and horses, wrapped in vines, slow panicked spread of scared people with no energy to flee
	 4. if germed up by now (fucking somehow), lots o signal, receive a sense memory of the death match (ala fantasia rite of spring)
 2. A company (12) of soldiers mounted on rot beasts lining a high ridge
	 1. Will retreat if approached, firing shots behind them as they flee 
 3. A mold farm (ideally stalkland)
	 1. Scorched land broken up  
	 2.
 4. A solider hunched over a rot beast with viscera laying around, will continue to eat until they leave, if interacted with she will look at you inquisitively, something will come over her and she will attack those that havent been marked
	 2. rotbeast has empty saddlebags full of collorful stains, and the pits of local stone fruit that grow on surrounding bushes
5.  5. An empty, remarkably human camp, animal carcasses litter the ground, chunks of meat and viscera have been torn from each body, lumber and felled trees are strewn across the entire area, a path points forward directing your attention towards a series of boats by the lake 
 Hey 

Encounter: 
A number of rudimentary long boats, are set to launch any minute now a nearly undefended city
