 # Omens
 1. A solider left behind delirious and fridged to the touch they murmur about refusing to drink the sap from the roots  
 2. clear signs of the march years ago
 3. A company (12) of soldiers lines a high ridge will firing arrows upon the party if spotted, but will retreat if approached
 4. A fresh battlefield, blood bubbling, hundreds of teloric soldiers and goblins in Arcadian livery lay face down in the mud, a lean horse pulls a body by a mangled leg caught in the stirrups, if approached its revealed that the body is a former solider and it will chase after you until killed
 5. An empty, remarkably human camp, animal carcasses litter the ground, chunks of meat and viscera have been torn from each body, lumber and felled trees are strewn across the entire area, a path points forward directing your attention towards a series of boats by the lake 


Encounter: 
A number of rudimentary long boats, are set to launch any minute now a nearly undefended city
