## RECAP

	 - the negotiation
## ACT I
- **They know the mission:** General Yenora's procession
	- in media res watching the generals arrival: Pearl, Tal, Poe, and Billiard are remarking on how nice fort raynault looks! An energy of nervous anticipation pervades the crowd, Sircha of [[House Follanel]] lounges in a box at the top of a newly constructed amphitheater. She is inoring an aid in medical garb shouting with exasperation and surveys her work with her customary wry smile. [[Sage Aelon|Aelon's]] spot is empty, unsurprising given her reclusiveness in the past couple months. Soldiers line the main road, standing at perfect attention, compensating for 3 months of slinking around with their tails beneath their legs, celebrating a 6th year to an invasion with almost nothing to show for it. They are practically giddy with the prospect of new **military** leadership, many of their eyes slide over you. They need someone to blame don't they!
	- one of pearls cohort whispers in her ear conspicuously gesturing at a group stand under the awning of Renta's Hold, Sezans inn, you see vanel, a lean human woman with shiny black hair in the rangers jumpsuit scowling at one of the soldiers

- **Entry:**
	- you step onto the staging ground, follanel harvesting equipment scatters the area and research station poe knows, usually bustling with focalist busy bodies lays splayed before, projects begrudgingly abandoned, most notably an entire 50ft stalk sample supported on itside and split in two, revealing a hollow center, hard membrane lining the outside and a slightly softer one on the inside, the two seperated by a smelly gel

## ACT II
 - **Killing Field** ==light sifts through the stalks, shadows lengthen as the sun goes unobstructed, steps sink farther into the ground and a small valley dotted with shallow pools reveals itself, around its perimeter where the basin pulls back up, dense stalks form a wall. studying further **insert weather feature**, highlight a heard of rot beasts at ease, dipping their heads into these pools. occasionally nipping at mounds of earth irregularly distributed about the area. focusing further on the far end the largest pile nearly all of the heard gathers at a large mound. You step forward and hear a crunch as bone breaks and an emaciated arm becomes clear under a shallow layer of dirt and white lace hyphae==

## ACT III

- **A Town**
- baricade up


- Is it problematic that the goblins have mind control? slave race: really really bad. maybe full stop. but maybe ic could be complicated, helps them connect, spiritually, emotionally, very Dionysian,

This conflicts directly with their authoritarianism 
feudalism does not tack onto this, 
they have systems of oppression but they are post influence slavery, 

Influencing does happen and people do fall victim to it, but unsolicited {connection} is frowned upon, violation of the social contract 

give them an opt in functionality, influence is ww

- Whose at play
	- goblin mayor
	- mindless and comander kael 
	- goblin wyrm toungue
- The wander
- 


organize silent guards, you get a meeting with a beurocrat 
- they already knew but they cannot budge the soliders are puppets of the goblins, and they would break a fey pact if they interfere

- on the prooving ground: investigating a mystery 
	- what is the deal why are they acting inhuman
	- who is this main vilan
		- whats his vibe,
		- office station
		- communing with arcadia 
			- signs of arcadia
			- bery vines with thorns growing around something
- fight a battle outside the city
- ==do these soliders pose a serious threat? Why == 
- treasure:
	- enough sugars to survive a couple months 

The mindless are doing something nefarious, atempting to provoke aggression

 ## Core puzzle

 - What Are they
 - Wh


# Nonsense Dump

	- 
- describe mechanics, give handout and rules] 20 min 
- play!




Vibes I want
- anticipation
- swept away - this drive is not going to pull them in
	- sacrafice someone
	- show an unkindness and a righteous path


Yenora arives,
aelon getting ready to flee
go find these soliders, they are in this direction and you get this reward,

WHAT do they theoretically get, money? freedom? better acomodations, autonomy, acess to their old lives, ownership? comfort?

go track down big bad guys and bring em home 




Questions
- how do we not negate all the work and set up done in hawthorne
- is it breethed (how to make this dramatic)
- 

Empty space and small adventures 

Somthing for the players to react to
- how has the camp changed over the past two months 
	- chaos, you find that food stores have been destroyed and railways have been sabotaged
	- focus and try to acheive flow
	- 
- the threat of death
- arival of [[General Yenora]], 
	- They start surveying the place, checking in on the resources, the troops, his officers collecting people for interrogation
	- sage aelon decides that you have incriminating evidence and attempts to hide you, when this fails she sends you into the woods 
	- 
 





 ## Into The Woods
- entering the woods they get a vision, the 





The Dagoag's tide is an adventure spanning A large section of the goblin hold
To call it its own arc is not incorrect but It ideally should be split into four

The discovery and slowing of the army, Breaking an alliance with the dragon preists of the northern mountains, and the crossing of enemy lines to slay prince dagoag 


To halt an army: in this adventure the party will discover a town on the road to the [[Xylaani Biomes and Geography|Purelake]], just ahead of a bridge that spans a treacherous section of river, [[Prince Dagoag|Arch Fey Prince Dagoag]] needs this crossing and thus has been sending knights to scout and secure the area 
- 
Hooks, 
- signs or rumors of an army building, Slaves taken to the yark 
- Rotted hands, breaking the 




The bridge was originally built by goblins, centuries ago, choosing to avoid desperate wildlife and Increased hunting competition with the local goblin clans and city states

>[!Info]
> 30 feet wide and 80 feel long,  a bridge spans the rotbless, a support beam seems to grow out of a bulge at the structures center drops down into the water, tapering down into a rough threadlike cylinder of twisting hyphae. That same hyphe Covering it is a thick layer of puffy moss, that obscures the bridges greys and yellows with vibrant green and snakes down to hang in a green translucent sheet between the support beam and the river bank dipping into the water

Sections of moss around the bridge are partially cleaned
the river has a save, if one were to fall in they would have oracular visiions
falling on one side means concewquenges 

we need something that can take advantage of knocking people into the river 
bug with big shovel head 
big armored gar live in the river 




goblin slaves have been been sent to spy and perform small raids to test defenses, so the town is ancy, they have generally heard of the occupation of {{southren goblin city}}
But little word has left the city since its closed its gates and the couruption of that city government has been an open secret for a long time. the town itself will be a huge strategic advantage should dagogs army take it, as it is well fortified and close enough to the bridge keep any large force from crossing. These people are farmers and hunters and bakers, there is a small gaurd force but only large enough to hold the gates and keep the peace. These people will be reluctant to leave but are possesed of enough fear, that they could be convinced to head to 

The party will eventually need to convince the town to head for [[{Goblin City}]] and abandon their town, [[Prince Dagoag|Dagoag]]'s forces wont move to kill them. However, if the paarty seeks to delay them, the bridge must be destroyed. Other crossings exist but none in the area would support the seige equipment that the Dagoag is planning to use on [[{Goblin City}]].
