You step forward and hear a crunch as bone breaks and an emaciated arm becomes clear under a shallow layer of dirt and white lace hyphae

 ## ACT III

[[Goblin]] strength, you are an outsider, not well coordinated, vicious, 

organize silent guards, you get a meeting with a beurocrat 
- they already knew but they cannot budge the soliders are puppets of the goblins, and they would break a fey pact if they interfere

		- office station

# Omens
 1. A half dug pit lays full to the brim with emaciated soliders almost untouched as if their flesh had nothing of desire 
 2. A solider left behind delirious and fridged to the touch they murmur about refusing to drink the sap from the roots  
 3. A company (12) of soldiers lines a high ridge will firing arrows upon the party if spotted, but will retreat if approached
 4. A fresh battlefield, blood bubbling, hundreds of teloric soldiers and goblins in Arcadian livery lay face down in the mud, a lean horse pulls a body by a mangled leg caught in the stirrups, if approached its revealed that the body is a former solider and it will chase after you until killed
 5. An empty, remarkably human camp, animal carcasses litter the ground, chunks of meat and viscera have been torn from each body, lumber and felled trees are strewn across the entire area, a path points forward directing your attention towards a series of boats by the lake 



























	- 
- describe mechanics, give handout and rules] 20 min 
- play!




Vibes I want
- anticipation
- swept away - this drive is not going to pull them in
	- sacrafice someone
	- show an unkindness and a righteous path


Yenora arives,
aelon getting ready to flee
go find these soliders, they are in this direction and you get this reward,

WHAT do they theoretically get, money? freedom? better acomodations, autonomy, acess to their old lives, ownership? comfort?

go track down big bad guys and bring em home 

































Questions
- how do we not negate all the work and set up done in hawthorne
- is it breethed (how to make this dramatic)
- 

Empty space and small adventures 

Somthing for the players to react to
- how has the camp changed over the past two months 
	- chaos, you find that food stores have been destroyed and railways have been sabotaged
	- focus and try to acheive flow
	- 
- the threat of death
- arival of [[General Yenora]], 
	- They start surveying the place, checking in on the resources, the troops, his officers collecting people for interrogation
	- sage aelon decides that you have incriminating evidence and attempts to hide you, when this fails she sends you into the woods 
	- 
 





 ## Into The Woods
- entering the woods they get a vision, the 





The Dagoag's tide is an adventure spanning A large section of the goblin hold
To call it its own arc is not incorrect but It ideally should be split into four

The discovery and slowing of the army, Breaking an alliance with the dragon preists of the northern mountains, and the crossing of enemy lines to slay prince dagoag 


To halt an army: in this adventure the party will discover a town on the road to the [[Xylaani Biomes and Geography|Purelake]], just ahead of a bridge that spans a treacherous section of river, [[Prince Dagoag|Arch Fey Prince Dagoag]] needs this crossing and thus has been sending knights to scout and secure the area 
- 
Hooks, 
- signs or rumors of an army building, Slaves taken to the yark 
- Rotted hands, breaking the 




The bridge was originally built by goblins, centuries ago, choosing to avoid desperate wildlife and Increased hunting competition with the local goblin clans and city states

>[!Info]
> 30 feet wide and 80 feel long,  a bridge spans the rotbless, a support beam seems to grow out of a bulge at the structures center drops down into the water, tapering down into a rough threadlike cylinder of twisting hyphae. That same hyphe Covering it is a thick layer of puffy moss, that obscures the bridges greys and yellows with vibrant green and snakes down to hang in a green translucent sheet between the support beam and the river bank dipping into the water

Sections of moss around the bridge are partially cleaned
the river has a save, if one were to fall in they would have oracular visiions
falling on one side means concewquenges 

we need something that can take advantage of knocking people into the river 
bug with big shovel head 
big armored gar live in the river 




goblin slaves have been been sent to spy and perform small raids to test defenses, so the town is ancy, they have generally heard of the occupation of {{southren goblin city}}
But little word has left the city since its closed its gates and the couruption of that city government has been an open secret for a long time. the town itself will be a huge strategic advantage should dagogs army take it, as it is well fortified and close enough to the bridge keep any large force from crossing. These people are farmers and hunters and bakers, there is a small gaurd force but only large enough to hold the gates and keep the peace. These people will be reluctant to leave but are possesed of enough fear, that they could be convinced to head to 

The party will eventually need to convince the town to head for [[{Goblin City}]] and abandon their town, [[Prince Dagoag|Dagoag]]'s forces wont move to kill them. However, if the paarty seeks to delay them, the bridge must be destroyed. Other crossings exist but none in the area would support the seige equipment that the Dagoag is planning to use on [[{Goblin City}]]. [[skiffs]] could be used but, in this area skiffs are unreliable, military use of them is unprecedented, and the [[Arcadian Court]] does not possess them in large enough numbers.



The bridge itself is a defunct a castle two stories, and currently haled by an andanvce party of dagoags soliders intending fo it to a be central 

Its gor













Remnants of the Giant folk exist in the forest, but will be threatened by the arrival of dagoags army, 

town and all that entails
Discovery of the Plan and the army, cause they hold a crusade banner, the military wants that banner
