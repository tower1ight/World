# Recap
- Fight with rotbeasts
	- Qball, Parsley, and Bill contrast a nasty case of forest rot, which is quickly set right by the holy hands of deko 
	- You heard a whistle calling the rotbeast away from your combat, which you narrowly brought down
- Poe took some samples and sent a message to a colleague, in the process learning that they were being pursued by a group from fort Raynault 
- Poe found a bunch of fruit in saddlebags worn by the rotbeasts. Used the tracks to lead you to a camp of the soliders that have been watching you
- You managed to avoid the notice of a four goblins in seagreen armor approaching the camp, Pearls raven, flying close to hear their conversation, immediatly tipped them to begin searching for you in three groups, one with two goblins, another with one goblin and two human, and the last with a goblin and a human
