	   - she witnesses the captain climb the stairs to an upper ledge in the cave, loop around the wall and open a hidden passage in the mountain. Additionally she hears the captain order explosives to be armed at the mouth of the cave and the bridge, and for the soliders to help move items
	   - While moving to leave tall spots a list on the captains desk, and fails her stealth roll to conceal the movement on the desk. she is about 50 minutes into this invisibility spell surrounded by gaurds 

   # Impressions
   - To do
	   - make the list interesting
	   - plan out exact enemy space 
   -  initial stuff is good, wistopher is silly and will lack depth
   - shit is moving so slowly 
   - its not as grounded, it doest feel colorful, its not evocative, start writing scene descriptions
	   - presentation is important 
   - know who you are talking about, find something you are interested in, you were unfocused, you will have more complexity and be able to express it in different waysw
