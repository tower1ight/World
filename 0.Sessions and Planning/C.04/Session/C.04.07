   # Recap

   # Impressions
   - To do
	   - make the list interesting
	   - plan out exact enemy space 
   -  initial stuff is good, wistopher is silly and will lack depth
   - shit is moving so slowly 
   - its not as grounded, it doest feel colorful, its not evocative, start writing scene descriptions
	   - presentation is important 
   - know who you are talking about, find something you are interested in, you were unfocused, you will have more complexity and be able to express it in different waysw
