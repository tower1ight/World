 # Recap
 - The gang entered the cave smelling a sweet aroma of decaying wood and organic material and the feeling of soft earth on a craggy cave floor
 - approaching a cultist body cautiously poe was able to spot something moving in the corpse, bugs quickly aprehened by a create bonfire from pearl
 - upon noticing mucusy threads throughout the ground and footsteps towards the signs of a fight, the group notices the nest of a giant centipede and the appearance of a animated critter, movement toward the nest prompted and attack from a few juvenile giant centipedes. The centipedes and the critter were thoroughly destroyed
 - Investigation of the critter allowed the party to find that the living mechanisms structure was similarly unknowable to something like a warforged, like a modrone hailing from the plane of mechanus
 - following footsteps further to a flowing river, tallet had a moment with a large mushroom, feeling pressure in her head and and a sense of longing when she retracted her hand
 - Billiard scouted ahead triggering active searching from a cultist guard 
 - the party surged forward choosing to rush in and take cover by some canoes, though the solider seemed to activate hidden turrets and get out of dodge
