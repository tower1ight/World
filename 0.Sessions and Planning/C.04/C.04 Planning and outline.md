## Landmarks

#### Dwellings 
 Dwellings should be representative of local customs, artistic and architectural trends
 - **Gristleak's Orchard**: mold farm and textile maker 
	 - The air is thick humid, you feel energized walking through a feild of elevated chambers, slightly opaqe and with small leaks forming at the seals where airflow is directed and the membrane is stressed from years of wear. they send you on a fetch quest to get chamber sealant, a weaving mill has goblins creating scafolding for [[mold]] to fill in the gaps,
	 - Busshels of mold have been stolen and they need to be returned 
	 - Abandoned when the party first visits but is occupied upon their return

#### Sanctuaries 
 Often Sanctuaries take the form of a temples around specific [[mycelium|nodes]] kept by the [[The Entangled|Seers]]. Most will contain a seer bent and contorted around the node at all times, many important nodes will have one or more seers who have chosen to embed themselves into the [[mycelium]]. The design of individual temples can vary but most have some form of material documentation of [[Xylaan]] and its worship or history.

### Monument
 Monuments are preserved moments embedded in the mycelium, visions of the past and the future, conjured as possibilities, if one is a very skilled walking among the likes of [[The Entangled|Seers]] they might be able to discern stylistic history, what the monument is and has been 
 - **Leaving the garden:** 
	 - massacre of remaining alchemists, and deserters caught, a wyvern with iredecent black scales hovers about: 
	 - Alchemists had lines, a shield wall and standard ww, but a flaming arrow strakes a flag with a single black scale. still attempting to keep discipline, kobolds have dissolved into their fighting squadrons attempting to reform the original structure. but five behemoth spiders cross the ridge, all of them stark white, clad in spotless mold-silver armor, the lead carrying a huge gilded command platform king glubliet standing at its head cape billowing in the wind, your breath catches as they barrel towards them, cutting them off and smashing these little islands apart. routed now, their retreat becomes a dash, trying to flee barbed legs and crooked arrows zipping in every direction. 
 - **A New Court:**
	 - development of the grove, a goblin settlement
 - **Sealed from the world:** 
	 - Ocean veiw off a cliff as the wind picks up and boats crushed against a storm maybe

### Hazards 
 Xylaan fights your every step. Hazzards are an opportunity for you to engage with the violence and beauty of the world around you, highlight a species in each 
 - **Anckeg:**
	 - Get inspired by the area, ankhegs are hunters, why do they hunt here
	 - you fight an ankheg
 - **Fire:**
	 - Fleeing heards of animals, enter a skill challenge, 
	 - weather determines the success of the skill challenge 
	 - a failed skill challenge results in an encounter with a fire elemental 
 - **River Monsters:**

### Curses 
 Curses often take the form of physical and mental distortion
 - **Bone Stalker**: 
	 - Distortion crackles in your mind, the familiar fuzz youve grown accustomed to, followed by a long squak you haven't yet hear, looking up you lock eyes with a large sleek light brown bird with a long neck and a tall jagged beak, the size of a large dog, and ornamented with many skulls it perches on a thick branch and gives a you a long stare, It lets out another squawk and this time you feel a wave of psionic energy, go go go and the forest erupts, hundreds of brown shaps zip past you, fluttering in every direction and the static intensifies, You feel one of them give out an exploratory clip of its beak at you, the static is building faster growing and growing until you cant see,  squeezing your eyelids against the pressure inside your head. and then suddenly its gone, the trees clear and whatever flock that was is gone. but you look around, hopelessly turned around and the forests shadows and shapes look different, you cant identify any landmarks **blinded** - 
	 - Bone-stalker, spots you, and pursues you, making very infrequent ranged attacks, waits untill your next predicament to attack
 - **Smoke:**
	 - You breath in and pick up the distinct smell of acrid smoke and you look up to find the sun with a much darker red then typicall. It glares back at you and you realize looking directly at it that you are being slowly enveloped by thick ashfall, soot clinging to your coats. 
	 - its just smoke floating over the stalkfeid, billowing marble drifts, holding shape
	 - **blinded** (A number of Hex's will have the fire hazard with acelerated chance of finding it)
 - **Hypnotic Cloud:**
	 - blood in your ears, your ears thuds and you are drifting , suddenly nauseous by a perceived elevation change and a strange twist to your vision. Your mind is swelling, make a con save, 
### Ruins
Ruins commonly provide helpful context or questions about xylaan, as well as a relic 
 - **Crashed Ship:** 
	 - containing [[Seraphs|seraphine]] tech just a few decades outdated
	 - notes from bigby's journal
	 - Dense forest 
	 - Upon walking through the forest, a claw-like formation of rock and moss appears to be jutting from the surface of the earth, almost curving back in upon itself in a sharp point. 
	 - Upon examine one of the walls of this formation, a small hole can be found, peering in, after a second to allow the eye to adjust to the dark, shows the faint outlines of walls, barrels and some kind of structure inside this formation. 
	 - if one were to examine the point at the top of the formation, *theyâ€™d find a metal tip of the channeling funnel of this machine*, yet they would only see it as a shining bit of silver, gleaming after being clean of moss and time. 
	 - Entering the structure requires breaking through the outer wall, which could be done delicately or with brute force. (Dex/Str) 
 - **Old vacuole pool:**
	 - a bountiful grove
	 - A community within the lake bed
	 - flower market
