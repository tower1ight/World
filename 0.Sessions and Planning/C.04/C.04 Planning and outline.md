### Dwellings 
 Dwellings should be representative of local customs, artistic and architectural trends
 - **Gristleak's Orchard**: mold farm and textile maker 
	 - The air is thick humid, you feel energized walking through a feild of elevated chambers, slightly opaqe and with small leaks forming at the seals where airflow is directed and the membrane is stressed from years of wear. they send you on a fetch quest to get chamber sealant, a weaving mill has goblins creating scafolding for [[mold]] to fill in the gaps,
	 - Busshels of mold have been stolen and they need to be returned 
	 - Abandoned when the party first visits but is occupied upon their return 
 - **Here kitty kitty**
	 - Here kitty kitty (book of challenges)
	 - house gaurd cat convinced by another cat to leave
	 - diplomacy,  violence, or failure possinle
		 - boost to goblin public opinon
 - **Ritual to the hags**
	 - collect a sacrifice
	 - 

### Sanctuaries 
 Often Sanctuaries take the form of a temples around specific [[mycelium|nodes]] kept by the [[The Entangled|Seers]]. Most will contain a seer bent and contorted around the node at all times, many important nodes will have one or more seers who have chosen to embed themselves into the [[mycelium]]. The design of individual temples can vary but most have some form of material documentation of [[Xylaan]] and its worship or history.
 
 - Bountiful Seer:
	 
	 - Flours speckle its body
	 - Asks you to excise the face and and plant it in a specific hex 
 - Stalk Seer
	 - Enter a grand structure of stalks bent hutlike into curved shapes in sequence, 
	 - Stalk fiber sits around the room in large 
	 - wistopher the bold germed up
 - Rotten Seer
 - Carved Seer

### Monument
 Monuments are preserved moments embedded in the mycelium, visions of the past and the future, conjured as possibilities, if one is a very skilled walking among the likes of [[The Entangled|Seers]] they might be able to discern stylistic history, what the monument is and has been 
 - **Leaving the garden** massacre of remaining alchemists, and deserters caught, a wyvern with iredecent black scales hovers about: Alchemists had lines, a shield wall and standard ww, but a flaming arrow strakes a flag with a single black scale. still attempting to keep discipline, kobolds have dissolved into their fighting squadrons attempting to reform the original structure. but five behemoth spiders cross the ridge, all of them stark white, clad in spotless mold-silver armor, the lead carrying a huge gilded command platform king glubliet standing at its head cape billowing in the wind, your breath catches as they barrel towards them, cutting them off and smashing these little islands apart. routed now, their retreat becomes a dash, trying to flee barbed legs and crooked arrows zipping in every direction. 
 - **A New Court** 
	 - development of the grove, a goblin settlement
 - **Sealed from the world** Ocean veiw off a cliff as the wind picks up and boats crushed against a storm maybe

### Hazards 
 Xylaan fights your every step. Hazzards are an opportunity for you to engage with the violence and beauty of the world around you, highlight a species in each 
 - **anckeg**
	 - you fight an ankheg
 - **Arcadian scouts**
	 - party of goblins with an few arcadians
 - **Fire**
	 - Fleeing heards of animals, enter a skill challenge, 
	 - weather determines the success of the skill challenge 
	 - a failed skill challenge results in an encounter with a fire elemental 
 - **River Monsters**

### Curses 
 Curses often take the form of physical and mental distortion
 - **Bone Stalker**: 
	 - Distortion crackles in your mind, the familiar fuzz youve grown accustomed to, followed by a long squak you haven't yet hear, looking up you lock eyes with a large sleek light brown bird with a long neck and a tall jagged beak , the size of a medium sized dog it perches on a thick branch and gives a you a long stare, It lets out another squawk and this time you feel a wave of psionic energy, go go go and the forest erupts, hundreds of brown shaped zip past you, flutting in every direction and the static intensifies, You feel one of them give out an exploratory clip of its beak at you, the static is building faster growing and growing until you cant see,  squeezing your eyelids against the pressure inside your head. and then suddenly its gone, the trees clear and whatever flock that was is gone. but you look around, hopelessly turned around and the forests shadows and shapes look different, you cant identify any landmarks **blinded** - 
	 - Bone-stalker, spots you, and pursues you, making very infrequent ranged attacks, waits untill your next predicament to attack
 - **Smoke**
	 - You breath in and pick up the distinct smell of acrid smoke and you look up to find the sun with a much darker red then typicall. It glares back at you and you realize looking directly at it that you are being slowly enveloped by thick ashfall, soot clinging to your coats. 
	 - **blinded** (A number of Hex's will have the fire hazard with acelerated chance of finding it)
 - **Hypnotic Cloud**


### Ruins
Ruins commonly provide helpful context or questions about xylaan, as well as a relic 
 - **Crashed Ship** 
	 - containing [[Seraphs|seraphine]] tech just a few decades outdated
	 - notes from bigby's journal
	 - Dense forest 
	 - Upon walking through the forest, a claw-like formation of rock and moss appears to be jutting from the surface of the earth, almost curving back in upon itself in a sharp point. 
	 - Upon examine one of the walls of this formation, a small hole can be found, peering in, after a second to allow the eye to adjust to the dark, shows the faint outlines of walls, barrels and some kind of structure inside this formation. 
	 - if one were to examine the point at the top of the formation, *they’d find a metal tip of the channeling funnel of this machine*, yet they would only see it as a shining bit of silver, gleaming after being clean of moss and time. 
	 - Entering the structure requires breaking through the outer wall, which could be done delicately or with brute force. (Dex/Str) 
*Breaking in may wake up whatever lies inside.*

###### **Rooms of Interest.**
**Lower deck hall.** Entering through the base of the formation the light from outside highlights dust and pollen kicked up by the PC’s entry. The hall is dusty, the air stale, moss and lichen form in clumps of various growth. The hall is made of an odd type of dark blue wood-like material, but with the hardness and coldness of stone. Upon some boards, sliver metal channels have been carved into them, all leading in a single direction, pointing further into the depths of the structure. 

**The Captains Quarters.** A dusty larger than average room, decorated in decayed banisters and moldy tapestries. Dominated by a large desk, a bed in a conjoined side room, a large wardrobe and a small chest, hidden under the bed. Upon the desk is the slumped mossy form of a figure. This husk of mold and moss will awaken if disturbed, attempting to grab those around it to spread the moss it’s made of. Around the husk’s neck is a strange key. 
Around the captains waist is a scabbard with a sword that looks to have melded with the moss in some way. 

**The Helm and Doorways.** After following the sliver lines, the group would be led through several large hallways, many of the supplies and rooms they pass covered in moss and mushroom/lichen growth. One passageway they pass looks like it has stairs down but it is blocked by a large tree that has seemingly impaled the structure of this ship. Upon reaching the end of the hall, there is a locked door with a small barred window at its center. Peering through, looks of a command center can be seen, with a large helm like steering wheel and several strange stations that lie dormant except for one that has a blinking red button. The door is locked, needing an exceptionally high lock picking roll or a key of odd design. 

**The Command Center.** This room contains mostly inoperable panels, buttons and levers. The helm is covered in moss, some of its material decayed. Yet, one panel, which has a number of silver lines leading to it, has a faintly glowing red button. 
This button could do two things:
- display a message from the first mate; “mayday, we have crashed in a strange jungle forest, many of the crew is dead, some of the crew is acting strange, we keep seeing something strange in the forest, the captains gone mad.” 
- Or, awakens the ship, channel stored power from the generations it has laid dormant, not to fly the ship, but to be a safe place to rest OR, to call attention to the ship and awaken strange mossy infected creatures who lie further below to begin coming up. 

 - **Old vacuole pool**
	 - a bountiful grove
	 - A community within the lake bed
	 - flower market 
 -  **Alchemist research station**
