  ### Skill Challenge
- Win and Loss Conditions 
	- Success: A number arbitrarily determined by the difficulty of a given challenge (often 3 - 9)
	- Failure: After 3 failed checks the party fails to complete the challenge resulting in a dire fate 
	- Consequence:  The consequences of failure and success are also determined arbitrarily but should be communicated thoroughly before the challenge begin
- Checks
	- Players can make a check at any time in any skill they are proficient in, so long as they give a sound explanation of its use
	- Upon failure of a check give the players an opportunity (see challenge prep) to either mitigate its consequences or on an outstanding roll or plan, negate the failure entirely
- Preparing the challenge 
	- Information communicated to the players
		- Write and opening dictation of the scene 
		- What is required for a success and a failure  
		- What is the result of a success
		- What is the result of a failure 
		- What are some suggested checks
	- Information not communicated to the players 
		- Determine 1 - 2 consequence of success for at least 7 likely skills to be used 
		- Create 5 small encounters as a result of failure as well as mitigation requirements 



 ### Exploration and Travel (Travel over exploration)
- Feeling
	- Above all exploration should feel ==evocative and grounded==
		- Super Natural (emphasis on Natural)
		- Irresistible and dangerous
		- But inspire strategic and interesting decisions that the players want to make
	- Route should be very easy to calculate 
		- You should know (roughly how long travel should take and the risks associated with it)
		- But there should always be uncertainty in it
			- ==What are you trying to preserve? safety? Time? an alternative objective?==
	- Danger of a given travel choice is a conversation with preparedness (level, experience, information) and the players surroundings (geographical area, weather, and local powers)
		 - growth of characters overtime, information, new forms of transportation, and defined routes 
	- Travel should add context and supporting information for future events
		- random encounters 
 - Mechanices
	- System
		- run as a dynamic hex map in foundry
		- broken up into 
		- really need to figure out how to automate this
	- Hex based travel
		- hex per day value modified by a number of factors
	- Modifiers
		- weather 
		- geographical impact 
		- information about the area
		- previously established routes 
	 - Possible abilities
		 - Expanded sight due to mycelial connection
		 - Vehicles, mounts, 
		 - Teleportation circles
		 - Escorting parties (temporary)
		 - biome based familiarity 
	 -
