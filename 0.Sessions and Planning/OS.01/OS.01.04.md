	   - A spell scroll of sending 
	   - A map of the caravans progress
	   - A map of the [[The Talons|Talons]] with several marked cult of the library cashes, one of which has a question mark and is closest to their current locations 
   - [[Charloneous Ball|charloneous]], with an unknown amount of time remaining, uses his cartographers tools to draw a very quick sketch of the caravans location as well as the immediate geography around the cult of the library cache with a question mark around it.

   - Claning ensues 
   - [[Itsy]] finds a panel on the underside of the caravan and sticks his head into the innards of the caravan, seeing two lard discs supporting a small device that he cant quite make sense of, mark and itsy recal that tampering with items build by the engineers guild is met with harsh consequences
   - Once you remove your attention from the vehicle you see that [[Esti]] has vanished.
