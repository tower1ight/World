	- They discover the book when closed is entirely clear 
	- There are a set of three grouping of runes etched into the spine of the book
	- when open the pages absorb all light 
	- When the light cantrip was cast on the tome, the spell was absorbed
	- when cast outside of the book, fuzzy lines of text were barely visible
	- through the curtains of the cart both the moonlight and sunlight (im not sure what i told you) but you would have seen these lines with less definition
	- When a source of heat came close to it, the book began to grow colder
	- when examined through a magnifying glass you were able to see a great deal of text layered onto itself (unclear about this one too)
