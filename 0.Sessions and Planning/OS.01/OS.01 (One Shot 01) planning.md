	- outline (tight 3 hours)
		- running 
			- what does running feel like, being pursued (skill challenge)
			- give them the ability to interact with [[[Captain Nyrelle|Nyrelle]]
		- recognizing being lost 
			-  write a detailed description of where they are
				-  in context of the "mountain"
				- what is the foliage like, give them info to use
	- Session three moving pieces
		- Book
			- Fitz
			- Could uncover on their own 
		- Captain nyrelle and her sending spell sheets
			- how do we get them to investigate
				- not movement or rusltling, maybe they need something 
				- what do they need 
				- keys
			- How do we make her likable 
				- Get protective 
				-  say she will keep watch and go on patroll
				- 
		-  kidnap red herring  
	- Timeline
		- why make it long
			- they need time to work on puzzle and coordinate 
			- 
		- solution: make longer part engaging 
		-  Introductions to the thing
			- Get aquinted with the situation
			- everyone get their jobs and whatnot
			- bring up concepts of the kidnapping
		- solving the puzzle, looking into the disapearance, learning more about captain 
		-  
	- Captian Nyrelle
		- What is she doing - coordinating the theft
		- forshadowing for cultist shit
			- Scrolls of message 
				- some of them have been used 
			- she was around the cultist attack
			- she tells them that fileral didnt want to tell them the contents of the package 
			- 
		- 
	- Reward for solving the books puzzle: 
		- Magic items
			- +1 buff given to sword
			- Immovable rod
			- ever smoking bottle 
			- boots of speed
			- ring of spell storing 
	- what does [[Charloneous Ball|Char]] instigate when they throw out papers 
		- Is the translation gone 
		- translation cannot take more time 
			- they might now have to riffle through piles (this is not fun)
		- Can fitz do this without the sheet
			- if so how do we signal  that he knows about prisms 
			- maybe a diagram of a prisms
				- papers about his prism enthusiasm
		- Is fitz into prismatic shit
			- he cant translate it without seeing it now?
			- con: is this too many red herring
			- 
			- 
	- THis sessions outline
		- opening description
		- let them investigate the bodies
		- they go back and deal with townsfolk
		- captain nyrelle takes them to her cabin to patch wounds, they see that the book has been stolen
		- captian nyrelle tells them she will go find it and that they should rest

	- cultist hints
		- something on the book? (no)
		- stuff on bodies after encounter (yes)
		- marks as a sign after the theft (no)
		- captain Nyreall tells them its cultist to scare them (yes)
			- tells them something along the lines  of  "[[Filleral]] didnt want me to tell you this"
			- they could end up taking this literally
	- whats going on here 
		- 
		- chasing them 
		- what does chasing feel like
			- lots of tight glimpses of them where they are unable to go after them
			- right on thier tail
				- illusion of closeness
		- dealing with the consequences of their actions
	- as you adnd captain nyrelle sprint through the woods, chasing your companions and your future advisors and council members you begin to take in your suroundings, ever observant of the goal and the teritory between you and It, you see hundreds of tall slender trees, white bark  looking almost wrinkled. as you rush through a small clearing, hot on their tail, you spare a glimpse for the tallons a heade of you, a tall spire being the closest thing to you.  Despite its proximity to the foothills it juts up, so steep it almost looms over you. 
	- Encounter one:
		- to chase
			- bounding through the trees whiping past branches and vegetation
			- they are getting tripped on very thin threads
				- DC 20 investigation to see the thread while moving 
				- DC 14 while not moving 
			- they are running and getting up and triping. and running and getting up and triping and runing and getting up and triping and runi
			- several dex checks 
			- 
		- In the far distance you see forms scurrying up a trees, as you reach the group of trees, you see figures doing a similar scurrying routine about a quarter mile away, captain nyrelle lets out a curse under her breath and rushes off to investigate new this new patch, and it happens again. this time the figures are not isolated to one place, you glimpse two forms in completely opposite directions 
		- 
		- to find 
			- Despite their relative inexperience with covering their travel, you are finding it difficult to locate thier trail, nyrelle is only a passable tracker and you certainly dont possess the skills to read trails while running so you slow your pace, searching slowly
			- Fall into a pit 
				- hear scurring around the base of the hovel 
				- a net is being woven around the mouth of your cave 
				- combat encounter at the mouth, they are always retreating
				- make a series of logs about where they are headed 
				- a series of perception checks with decreasing values to see that they are headed in the opposite direction of the mountain 
		- to push 
			- in sight stopping a larger force from reaching them 
		-  Old abandoned town
			- has an entrance to the cashe 
			- town was abandonded for a reason
				- pushed out?
				- driven undergrowund 
				- why did the cultists select it 
			- mine has been caved in 
				- can acess it if you do right, otherwise you triggwer a collapse 
				- captain nyrelle will try to trigger
			- better and more well established route in through a hole in the archives

 # Plot
 ## Concept
  party members are part of a [[focal council]] departing from their town with a mysterious package and a note requesting that they bring said package to the violet churches archives  
  [!info] kcnacas
 ## Outline
- Preliminary Note
	 - [[Gort]] is a mining town on the far outskirts of [[Allyol]] and nestled into the foothills of [[The Talons]]. Small and comfortable, it is home to 80 - 100 people and has been your home for 17 years +- 1. With a shake or shout you were woken from bed approximately 7 hours ago, around 2 am, with a request to meet with Gort's focal leader Filleral. In a somewhat rushed and unceremonious meeting he let you and your 3 compatriots know that you,  accompanied by captain Nyrelle, are to be sent off to the [[Violet Church]] as pupiols that will someday makeup Gorts [[focal council]], at midday when the [[Teloric Caravans|caravan]] departs from the town. The day whips past you as you pack your bags and say your farewells for a trip you expected at least a months warning for, if you expected it at all.
	 - Some roleplay food for thought:
		 - You will not return for at the 5 years at the latest, 
		 - At the end of those years do you expect to return to town? 
		 - If you do, do you expect top be an archivist, a focalist guide, or your towns future focal leader
		 - how do you feel about your exit?
		 - Why were you chose?
		 - 
		 - 
- Introduction
	- group comes into focus in the back of a [[Teloric Caravans|caravan]]
	- [!INFO]  you all find yourself sitting in the back of a wagon giving a long look out the open back of your cart, the figures of your town waving off your departure are slowly loosing definition, fading into [[The Talons]].  Captain Nyrelle Has just taken her leave of you, telling you all she would return shortly as she walked through the set of curtains opposite the rear. 
	- For the first time you glance around your cart, the floor is a large wooden base attached to several tall metal arches that support a thick canvas making up your walls your current room's perimeter is defined by curtains that divide a single large platform into serval discreet rooms. Your section at the rear has a large bay window like set of curtains. Several rectangles are cut into the floor with deep word groves around their edges and latches set into the floor top hold them in place
	- in luggage there is a large package wrapped in parchment with an envelope attached to it
		- [!NOTE] I am so deeply sorry for forcing you to leave with this little time to say goodbye, but if you have a fraction of the fun and excitement I had when I was young and in your shoes it will be well worth it. However, you can trust i did not do this with no reason, Last night petyr (you remember peter as one of the more proficient miners in your town) found something extraordinary. He found an old [[Cult of the Library|cultist]] stash in the natural cave system of the talons. We've taken multiple of the stashed volumes into the libraries collection, but the [[focal council|council]] l agreed that this package should be delivered to the violet church's archivists for safe keeping. We did not expect to send you so soon, but we figured this was the best way to get this out of Gort as fast as possible without raising suspicion. Try to learn as much as you can about it before you present it to the archivists, just remember discression is key. Good luck, best [[Filleral]]
