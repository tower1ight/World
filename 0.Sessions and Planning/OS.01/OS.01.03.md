   # Recap
   - captain Nyrelle tells you all that she heard from Paulina about the burning spell scroll last night. She asks how you all are doing and feeling and tells you all that she will be doing patrols
   - Nyrelle, Itsy, and mark do warmup exercises, mark and itsy fail to do a pull up 
   - Esti speaks to Paulina about the abduction and learns that Yeital (the textiles maker), was abducted by 3/4 bandits and put into a wagon
   - The gang heads back to the cart and Nyrelle says she will ride with Paulina giving them book experimentation time 
	   - it grows cold after contact with a lit match and absorbs several instances of the sacred flame spell 
		   - with seeming diminishing returns
	- They discover that a sacred flame or light spell will make projections beyond the page, lines with extremally complex designs and patterns of text
- Mark itsy and captain Nyrelle have a great afternoon,  they go on a short hike and swim in a lake that captain Nyrelle is familiar with 
- Against the clear protests of Esti, charloneous asks fiz a number of convoluted hypothetical questions
	- char discovers that the runes on the spine of the tome are written in prismatic
	- but the  translation sheet required to get a good picture of what these runes say has been mysteriously thrown out (possibly mistaken as trash)
	- Char does learn that prismatic is built around projecting thought through impressions 
	- char also learns expansiveness of fitz's appetites 
- Char focuses on the runes on the back of the tomes spine and gets three distinct images :sun, rainbow, ink
- dinner rolls around and captain Nyrelle announces that they will be going on patrol
- Itsy follows, is detected, and sent back to camp only to hear a shreik come from the forest about 15 min later
- they follow seeing a cart with a rustling sack in it. Mark charges in and is swiped up by a net
- Two bronze automatons crash down in front of and behind the party 
- combat ensues

Impressions, 
- Combat really stressful at the begining
- I forgot multiattack, battle didn't have stress after the first round 
- I dont feel like im communicating alarge parts of this story
