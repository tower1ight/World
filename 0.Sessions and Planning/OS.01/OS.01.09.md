   # Recap
   - big battle 
   - entered and veered to the left 
   - [[Esti]] immediately  found a hatch
   - after defeating serveral [[Animated Critter]]s and deleting an animated frame, [[Itsy]] and [[Esti]] ascend the steps in rec room to find a viewing deck
   - Looking into the chasm [[Esti]] determined that there were massive prismatic runes lining the bottom in a chain creating a source of powerful abjuration magic

   # Impressions
   -  I spend a lot of the time putting out vtt fires
   - grouped initiative would be much better
   - i need to make the scene into levels rather than multilevel tokens
   - Music was good, get more
   - I expected a chase, entice your players to move where you want 
   - music and visuals are a proxy, paint the scene
