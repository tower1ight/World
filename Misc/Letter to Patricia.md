Hey, I'm not sure why I've taken so long to just sit down and write this, I think a number of reasons can be highlighted but chief among them is an inability to simplify important concepts that have come to mean a lot to me. 
**Do I try to explain this thing with terms and definitions?** Well that route feels like cold taxonomy, something that can really only offer shallow information. 
**Do I try to sell you on a worldview?** While this will get closer to understanding my perspective, that perspective would be singular and a lot of the power within this community comes dissimilar people and perspectives bound by similar feelings. 
**Do I try to hand wave this away?** This is very tempting, but explaining trans people by saying "its complicated", though true, puts walls around these concepts. 

**Terms**
So basically I think the thing thats most important to know is that **trans** is an umbrella term for people who's experience with gender is atypical. For this reason efforts to categorize and boil down the trans term will always work to divide us and leave vulnerable people out to dry. That being said, words are practical and communication is very difficult without them. Here is a term glossary: https://transactual.org.uk/glossary/

**Discrimination, Dogwhistles, and Control**
Why do I think this happens: Some may disagree but I largely think its about control and disgust, I think most lgbtq+ discrimination has to do with an underlying disgust response and deviating from dominant cultural norms. Feminist literature spends a lot of time talking about how dividing men and women into two solid categories with different traits, skills, and roles, makes both groups easier to control and exploit. Critiques to that rigid picture of gender almost always threaten those systems of accepted exploitation, 

When a cis woman chooses to not shave her legs, like it or not that choice says something about her level of commitment to the patriarchal ideal of a desirable woman. Transness like feminism is the process of demanding freedom in those choices, and ensuring legal protections for those whose lives and identities do not match that rigid idea of man and woman. 

Trans women are often depicted as threats to cis women and children, we are a scapegoat to the sexual violence that is permitted in our society 

Trans men are often erased, seen as confused young girls
