Hey, I'm not sure why I've taken so long to just sit down and write this, I think a number of reasons can be highlighted but chief among them is an inability to simplify important concepts that have come to mean a lot to me. 

**Do I try to explain this thing with terms and definitions?** Well that route feels like cold taxonomy, something that can really only offer shallow information. 
**Do I try to sell you on a worldview?** While this will get closer to understanding my perspective, that perspective would be singular and a lot of the power within this community comes dissimilar people and perspectives bound by similar feelings. 
**Do I try to hand wave this away?** This is very tempting, but explaining trans people by saying "its complicated", though true, puts walls around these concepts. 

**Terms**
So basically I think the thing thats most important to know is that **trans** is an umbrella term for people who's experience with gender is atypical. For this reason efforts to categorize and boil down the trans term will always work to divide us and leave vulnerable people out to dry. That being said, words are practical and communication is very difficult without them. Here is a term glossary: https://transactual.org.uk/glossary/

**What I am trying to pursue**
Personally I had not really 


**Discrimination, Dogwhistles, and Control** 
Why do I think discrimination happens: Some may disagree but I largely think its about disgust and control, I think most lgbtq+ discrimination has to do with queer people deviating from dominant cultural norms and  underlying disgust at queer bodies. Feminist literature spends a lot of time talking about how dividing men and women into two solid categories with different traits, skills, and roles, makes both groups easier to control and exploit. Critiques to that rigid picture of gender almost always threaten those systems of culturally accepted exploitation.

There is nothing natural about shaved legs, but our cultural idea of femininity is associated with smooth skin. When a cis woman chooses to not shave her legs, like it or not that choice says something about her level of commitment to the patriarchal ideal of a desirable woman. Transness like feminism is the process of demanding freedom in those choices, and ensuring legal protections for those who cannot conform to the gender roles of the sex they were assigned at birth.

The dominant rhetoric about Trans women often depicts us as imposters, threats to cis women and children. We are used as a scapegoat for a society that is comfortable with violence towards women. Im of the opinion that when our communities are not willing to hold men accountable, it becomes far easier to say that that violence is inevitable, that something about men (their biology) that is inherently hostile and cannot be blamed for the harm they do. So if you refuse to believe I am a woman, I become a dangerous presence in women's spaces, biologically driven to hurt people. Hence our depiction as monsters and freaks

The dominant rhetoric about trans men is closer to erasure, often seen as confused young girls sacrificing their womanhood. Conservatives will emphasize their biology by pointing to loss of fertility as a loss of function (see a very famous anti trans book called "irreversible damage" , a loss of purpose.
