 # what is it

one of the three greatest [[Teloric Government|noble houses]] in [[Telor]]

- Focus on literature, art, sculpture,  history, theology
- Based in [[Vorvelal]]
- Other pursuits and large volume products: popular source of information and reporting (the violet church and the throne put out “official” reports on news, policy, current events, culture etc, and these are broadly respected by teloric citizens. However, House Kahdar is significantly more culturally relevant,  is respected as a valuable source of information, but its popular because its significantly more entertaining, and often has altogether better reporting and contextualizes its content through both historical and narrative lenses)
- Connected with [[The Ascendant Halls]] and thus the arts and theory of divine magic
- Holds a deep respect for archival work and employs many traveling historians and bards
