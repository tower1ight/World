thick whispy grass surround you, thick roots in the ground lets hundreds of fine frauns, they drift slowly with the with the wind, the earth is soft here, very dificult to run in. Steady flexible movements and psionic coordination allow those skilled in it to walk with it unhindered. Sad, you don't have that yet. you fall onto it learning that it will support your weight and in the same moment you are pulled beneath, staring a jungle of activity bellow, arachnids rest in burrows, a rodent like creature the size of a small dog digs throughs a large invertebrate, its claws tearing through thin skin on its underside.
