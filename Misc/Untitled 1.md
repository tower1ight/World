I am very sad 
let us count the ways
1) I am so very bored: I worked from home and got out at three, couldnt think of what to do with my time, Tried to write and that didnt work, went out and sat in the sun for an hour and a half, I am sober out of what feels like necessity
2) julia is leaving: not much more to it i dont know what im going to do and I become more distraught day by day. I dont think I understood how much I had tied my identity to her 
3) I am adrift in life, I dont know what to do and I have no real desire to amount to anything 
4)
