   # Recap
   - they had a big figh it lasted a whiklll'
   - thjey sucessfully delayed the rotbeast for two turns
   - there were many invisible goblins
   - there were many killed soliders
   - gourmand did a thing with the transforming uinto a rot beasat and locking horns with the other 

   # Impressions
   - comabt went loooooong,
   - once again I feel that a mo0re narated combat would have been better, telegraphing the moment with the rotbeast was great, do more of that
