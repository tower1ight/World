 # A land of isolation, it's creation is a fey tale and it's flesh is something else entirely
like everywhere of importance dragons had touched this place before, vermin these little wyrms, everywhere you look sprouting up like tulips! A great forest held valaxys a great beast that presided over the land with vauge concern, kobolds called it home and tinkerd for a time, they are of note and I hold them in high regard, but the camera must pan to a grand tree at xylaan's heart, held with high enough regard to bleed into the feywild and providing a unique offer for queen mab, the greatest of archfey at the time in desperate need for an escape from a sticky situation. Pursued by the the [[The Circle of Eight|Eight]] with the particular interest of yours truly, the fey had decided to hide a [[Prism]] that had fallen into their hands. alas we have not always been the bastion of responsibility or and our organizations greatest work in the millennia that we operated had been scattered to the wind, at the whim of every individual that lusted for incalculable power. I, volunteering to find this masterpiece, I found the task more difficult than I could have possibly imagined and I found myself looking i circles, my connections there bore no fruit and entire lifetimes spent with these archfey was apparently not worth the answer to my questions. For decades I wandered, in the end finding my search concluded by this tree before us, its hiding place in the material plane almost as gualing as my inability to take it back. 

Queen mab you see had demonstrated remarkable foresight, acknowledging a skirmish with a separatist sect of her court, and in recent position with a reality bending artifact she banished both to the material plane before the [[The Circle of Eight|Eight]] before we had even realized they were gone. The [[Arcadian Court| Court of Arcadia]] with that aforementioned immense power and new lands entirely sovereign to them had dutifully played the part, staging a rebellion with flourish and zeal. They left and the portal closed behind them with theatrical finality. The goblin court, always eager for influence and unmatched in their nastyness, has a pension for throwing wrenches into grand narratives, they had learned of Arcadias Pact with [[Queen Mab]] and stowed away many of their courts most vile and tricksy individuals. Without this digression from the plan I may have overlooked this place for even longer. 

When I finally layed my eyes on the tree I knew instantly that we could never restore the sphere, something grander undulated beneath my feet, an organism the capacity and, unbeknownst to me, the inclination for godhood, the prism, trapped in the interdimentional heart of the tree syphoned off [[focus]] from [[The Prismatic Whole]]. Our work had surpassed us and created the most beautiful thing I had ever seen
