My name is Sam (she her), I am a 25 and I work as an analytical chemist. I am very interested in the Attic Bedroom you have listed.

About me!
I love to cook, read, draw, play video games, sew (on the newer side of this hobby) and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games. When it comes to what I am like as a roommate, I like to keep my spaces pretty clean, and I like to decorate, especially for parties or having friends over. I smoke weed often so this may not be the best fit if that poses serious problems for the house, however, I am more than happy to discuss boundaries about that <3.

Fav thing to cook: Ive been on my bean stew game for years now, I do not care that its the summer it is always the season for bean stew!
