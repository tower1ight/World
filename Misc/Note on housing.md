Hello,
My name is Sam (she her) {trans flag}, I am a 25 and I work as an analytical chemist. I am very interested in the Attic Bedroom you have listed.

While I have never participated in a live in coop, I worked as one of the head cooks for two and a half years at my colleges dining coop, I truly loved and cherished the experience and some of my strongest connections have come from 

About me!
I love to cook, read, draw, play video games, sew (on the newer side of this hobby) and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games. When it comes to what I am like as a roommate, I like to keep my spaces pretty clean, and I like to decorate, especially for parties or having friends over. I tend to cook a lot so I love to share and I come bearing a some equipment and a small cookbook collection. I smoke weed often so we may not be the best fit if that poses serious problems for you, however, I am more than happy to discuss boundaries about that <3.

I'm looking forward to meeting you
