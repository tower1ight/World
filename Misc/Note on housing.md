Hello,
My name is Sam (she her) {trans flag}, I am a 25 and I work as an analytical chemist.  I am looking for a bedroom for the start of the September cycle.

Budget: ideally under 1200, can go to 1300 if necessary
Move in September 1st




Some things I love to cook, read, and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games.
