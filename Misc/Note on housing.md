About me!
I love to cook, read, draw, sew (on the newer side of this hobby) and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games. When it comes to what I am like as a roommate, I like to keep my spaces pretty clean, and I like to decorate, especially for parties or having friends over. I tend to cook a lot and come bearing a small cookbook collection. I smoke weed often 
Im looking forward to meeting you
