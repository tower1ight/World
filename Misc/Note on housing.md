About me!
I love to cook, read, draw, sew (on the newer side of this hobby) and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games. When it comes to what I am like as a roommate, I like to keep my spaces pretty clean, and I like to decorate, especially for parties or having friends over. I tend to cook a lot so I love to share and I come bearing a some equipment and a small cookbook collection. I smoke weed often so we may not be the best fit if that poses serious problems for you, however, I am more than happy to discuss boundaries about that <3. I am about a year into transition 
Im looking forward to meeting you
