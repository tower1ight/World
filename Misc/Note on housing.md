Hello,
My name is Sam (she her) {trans flag}, I am a 25 and I work as an analytical chemist. I love to cook, read, and write, some fiction, mostly things for tabletop roleplaying games. I am looking for a bedroom for the start of the September cycle.

Budget, ideally under 1200, can go to 1300 if necessary
