 # Summary
 ## Visual description
 ## Who are they

Sage kai is a manipulitive, brilliant, sadist, though a puipil with sage aelon in the early days, before the usurpation, the study always paled to the power it granted. As a diplomat he built some of [[Telor|Telor's]] most fundamental relationships, {[[{cathedral isles}]]}, [[Hythriel]], [[Allyol]]

good with words, better with song, he will do what he needs to twist a story and somehow keep you happy about it. He is eager at the change to play the game with aelon again.
