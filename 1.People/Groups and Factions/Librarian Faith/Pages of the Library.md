The Teloric [[Gate]] was hidden among the [[Elves|Elves]] of [[Hythriel]] or [[Hythriel|The_Azurite_Glade]] as you might know it. For millennia, led by the [[Stewards|stewards]] selected among them, they worshiped this structure shrouded in so much mystery as [[Pages of the Library|pages]]

Core values 
-   Emphasis on documentation but most importantly the democratization of knowledge
-   Again: Discovery is a violent and invasive process, a balance must be struck between creation and caution.  One should care as much (if not more) for consequences a creation poses as they do for the creation itself

Prayer: In many ways the method of a page’s prayer is similar to a [[Focalism|focalist]]
- The verbiage is essential to the difference as the process of prayer is nearly identical. A Page performs [[focus]] when the are “learning” as opposed to a [[Focalism|focalist]] who would meditate on the acts of “creation” and “discovery
-  A page uses [[focus]] when they engage in what they consider to be “ learning”
