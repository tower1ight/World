up: [[Worship of the Library]]

The Cult of the Library is a splinter of the Pages, believing that The Library has reevaluated those who it deems responsible enough for access through its gates.  Function as a secret society with codified hierarchy

Values
- They believe that not only is another [[Gate|gate]] open, but that they are being called to it.
- Cultist's search [[Telor]] and beyond, making an endless pilgrimage to the new [[Gate|gate]]
-  Additionally they seek to hide any physical documents or information that originated from the [[The Great Library|Library]]as only minds were wiped in the [[The Erasure]].

Iconography: symbol of a burning page with an inscribed gate

Prayer: In many ways the method of a cultist's prayer is the same as a [[Pages of the Library|page's]] and as a result is similar to a [[Focalism|focalist's]]
- The verbiage and concept of prayer, like a [[Pages of the Library|page]], is based in [[focus]] through, what they consider to be “learning”
- In particular cultists fixate on pieces of knowledge or artifacts left over from the [[The Great Library|Library]], hiding them away and holding them with utmost importance as they believe them to be extremely dangerous.
	- it is a big deal when a cultist is considered to be "ready" by their compatriots to be shown an "artifact in their hiding places"

Pilgrimage
- Cultists travel the world looking for the [[Gate|gate]] that they "know" the [[The Great Library|Library]] has formed 
- Cultists are also searching the [[Urat|world]] for artifacts and knowledge from the [[The Great Library|Library]], 
	- additionally they have vaults scattered across [[Telor]] that those who have been granted access by the group make journey to

Hierarchy: the basis for the hierarchy is in allowed knowledge, giving certain types of members special and discrete information.
- Cultist, awareness of its members
-  members of the [[The Shroud]]
- idky
- idky
- Potentate
- Gatestone : Objects said to be deemed worthy of entrance to the library. These objects not only are sentient and are the greatest respoitories of knowledge, have an affinity to the gate and know its location
	- They act as sponges for the library's and cultist's knowlege, allowing them to syphon off knowledge or memories from an individual if they deam that individual unworthy.
