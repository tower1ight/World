 # what is it
 an ancient order of wizards that studied and wielded the [[The Prismatic Whole]]

Organization Structure and Current members
Mordenkainen (Leader), Bigby, Tenser, Jallarzi, Leomund, and Otiluke 

The Circle was founded in [571 CY] by Mordenkainen, from the remnants of the Citadel. The exact make-up of the eight has changed over time and has continued to remain somewhat of a secret to the general populace of the Flanaess. Gygax has said the original Circle of Eight was composed of his player charactersâ€”Mordenkainen, Yrag, Bigby, Rigby, Ziggby, Felnorith, Vram, and Vin. In the novels, the Circle was expanded to encompass other PCs such as [Tenser](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Tenser "Tenser") (originally played by Ernie Gygax).[[5]]

Among the group's original members were former Citadel members Mordenkainen and Bigby, and soon was comprised of the wizards [Bucknard](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Bucknard "Bucknard"), [Drawmij](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Drawmij "Drawmij"), [Leomund](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Leomund "Leomund"), [Nystul](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Nystul "Nystul"), [Otto](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Otto "Otto"), [Rary](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Rary "Rary"), and an unknown ninth mage._[citation needed]_ In [574 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/574_CY "574 CY"), the unnamed member left to explore other planes of existence,[[4]] and was replaced by former Citadel member Tenser

In [576 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/576_CY "576 CY"), [Otiluke](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Otiluke "Otiluke"), president of Greyhawk's [Society of Magi](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Society_of_Magi "Society of Magi") and member of the city's [Directing Oligarchy](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Directing_Oligarchy "Directing Oligarchy"), joined the Circle, replacing Leomund, who had retired earlier that year. In [579 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/579_CY "579 CY"), Bucknard mysteriously disappeared,[[4]] and was not replaced until [581 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/581_CY "581 CY"), when [Jallarzi Sallavarian](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Jallarzi_Sallavarian "Jallarzi Sallavarian") became the first woman to join the Circle of Eight.[[7]](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Circle_of_Eight#cite_note-dragon-i405-p3-aHistory_Check:_Rary_the_Traitor-7) (Bucknard was eventually found to have died while exploring.)

Later, in [581 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/581_CY "581 CY"), nearly six months after Jallarzi joined, the group met with tragedy when all its members, save Mordenkainen, were slain by [Halmadar](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Halmadar "Halmadar") the Cruel, a former [Shield Lands](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Shield_Lands "Shield Lands") tyrant under the control of the fabled lich [Vecna](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Vecna "Vecna"), who had somehow achieved godhood. Mordenkainen responded by assembling a group of "small cadre of apprentice wizards, former companions. and long-time confidantes"[[4]](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Circle_of_Eight#cite_note-lgj-i0-p6-a-4) to thwart Vecna's plans, and was able to recover the remains of his allies and clone them. The cloning took some time, which could otherwise have been used to prevent the [Greyhawk Wars](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Greyhawk_Wars "Greyhawk Wars"). (Cook, _[Vecna Lives!](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Vecna_Lives! "Vecna Lives!")_)

By [584 CY](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/584_CY "584 CY"), the Circle was fully restored and working toward an end to the Greyhawk Wars. On the eve of the day when all parties involved were to sign the treaty bringing the wars to an end, Otiluke, Tenser, and Bigby discovered a plan by the Circle's own Rary to slay all the assembled diplomats via a great magical trap. Unfortunately, Rary witnessed their discovery, and a great magical battle ensued, resulting in the deaths of Otiluke and Tenser, and severely wounding Bigby, who was unable to pursue Rary as he escaped.
