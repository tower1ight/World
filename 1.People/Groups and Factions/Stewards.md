The [[Gate|gates]] of the [[The Great Library|Library]] were always meant to be hidden from the eyes of the hasty. The entrances were hidden among creatures that were deemed responsible enough to handle the dangers within. A special few were given full access to its depths. An order of librarians kept its halls and managed its affairs. They came to be called the libraries “Stewards.” A title that marked one committed to not only the care of the [[The Great Library|Library]] but for the execution of its vision as its deific word. 

A steward was sent to distribute knowledge as they traveled, but most importantly to prepare the world for the library to reemerge.
