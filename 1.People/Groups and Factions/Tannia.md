Tannia (plural) Tannian (singlular) great Tannia (honarific)

[[{disconnected city}]]

 # Goals and Core tenants
-
	 - Intense adherence to personal liberty is core to their beliefs as a community that has succeeded from [[Xylaan]]. This is complicated by a fuzzy boundaries on the individual. This manifests as an anarchical society facilitated by each individuals consent to participate in the unit. consequences of this idea range from a virtually unlimited capacity for division
	 - Free [[Xylaan]] 
		 - containment 
			 - Create a catalytic converter to block communication out of the forest
			 - missionary work
			 - 
	 - trying to create plant communication not facilitated by [[Germ]]
		- Living with a restrained elderbrain system housed in the tallons 
		- works as a defense system to rival [[Xylaan]]
		- how is it restrained: unclear 
		- is trying to develop a germ sytem on the same level 
		- what are its limitations: 
			- spacially sefmented: more resistance
			- has hard limits: no remote casting, dulled and dormant germ system causing a lack of complete symbiosis

Their city exists in a series of simulated ecological systems, trying to create a simulation of their homeland

Ok here is what we know thus far
 - they are formerly part ox Xylaan 
 - they are duty bound to keep xylaan contained 
 - germ scientists and growers
	 - 
	 - they are entirely motivated by their environment, it is their cultures work 
		 - they tend to it, grow with it 
		 - they live 
	 - A fungus grows throughout the entire cave system they have dug into the talons  
 - they live in cities on either end of the talons as well as in the cave system that runs between them their cities are enormous gardening and ecological projects, they see themselves as members of the environment 
- governance
	- how many of them are they: 20, 000 people?
	- Steam Anarchy:
		- put work into anything you want to, 
		- exercise no violence
		- mob justice punished by excommunication

 ## Anti-Psionics:
one might identify alchemists solely with their creation of anti-psionic technology, It builds some of the most foundational aspects of their culture, history, and identity. From the moment it was born the kobolds were set apart from xylaan as a community, they had opted out of xylaan's body and were met with swift retrobution. what followed was an ethnic cleansing of monumental proportions. 

When first created, anti-psionics were individual, a way of cutting ones [[Germ]] off from the network and all psionic forces. The first iterations of this left the germ more or less inept, removing the users ability to metabolize xylaani [[Ichor]] and but soon they developed tech for this shit 

After creating ways to turn this technology outward they were able to develop decices capable of emiting an antipsionic feild, ssomething that allowed them to create the deadlands, gradually pushing xylaans border further and further back. the Boundaries that exist now have been more or less static for decades, marking the limit for what the alchemists can reasonably commit to powering, maintaining, and defending. 


 ## Bioengineering

Leaving xylaan took everything from them, forced to live in a dry baren land, with no food and unimaginable wsilence. Running against the clock to cultivate life that could exist outside of xylaan. They barely managed it, living a profoundly hollow existance devoid of song. The alchemists long for a world teaming with the life they gave up.  even now centuries after their exodus they dream of it. 

Part of this deream is the [[mycelium]]  that is the closeness they lost, some want it back, some fear what that would require. The {{dsfjihsdf}} war occurred because of a schism in the alchemist community. Experimentation on a mycelium of their own  sparked a fundamentalist backlash and ultimately a secession. The fundamentalist community split off from the original state and established a community of their own where the [[The Talons|Talons]] meet the sea. the two factions have diplomatic relations and are bound by  the same cause

At the moment a large engineered mycelium network  flows throughout of a great deal of the talons,  the network allows them to communicate rapidly, as well as store and access information. There is much that distinguished their network from xylaan, for one, its dramatically less strong, rendering it incapable of controlling its symbiotes or rendering complex inf9ormation like any that xylaani [[polyphony| languages]] would transmit. Additionally it has been designed to retain and store information under limited circumstances, making it completely reliant on the alchemists for its care.

 ##  Govenment structue
 - they are so fucking hype about communtiy ebngagemen, want everyone to communicate to an ajdudicator
 - Steam levels of community reasignemtn
