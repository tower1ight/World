## Focus in Focalism
On a fundamental level [[focus]] is concentrated meditation. Full body and mind devotion to [[Tel'Voric]], but more importantly to the work they are creating. It is akin to quiet one might feel when reading a particularly thrilling textbook. Some describe it as Euphoric yet grounded, open and closed, exploratory but directed, or any number of other contradictory word pairs.

[[focus]] is a concept that is shared among nearly all cultures who study and practice magic. However, very few of them treat it with as much reverence and religious significance as the Teloric people. 

The practice of [[focus]] has a couple of results and applications. Some Focus for the art of Focus itself, but most worship occurs within creative and exploratory work. Their effort manifests itself in a very real connection to [[Tel'Voric]]. Through this bond, those that are particularly adept at entering a state of Focus can sometimes see visions or sparks of inspiration from their [[god]]

## Personal Significance: 
Focalism is ingrained in the culture of the [[Telor|Teloric]] people. As its form of worship is so personal and at times, private, ones connection with the church is almost always a singular [[Teloric Government|guide]] that personally helps and trains them in pursuing focus through their craft. For the guide this entails directing the community member to information, aiding them in documentation , and helping them set up their workshop and get the materials necessary for their craft.

## Community Significance:
A focalist church is cultural and educational hub for a community,

A single church will serve a town as a library and archive, a schoolhouse, a communal and academic workshop, and government office

Due to the load required from performing this many community needs, in small towns these churches provide housing and work to at least 15 devoted focalist priests and adepts. 

In cities, these facilities become massive, sometimes requiring hundreds of people to function. Many large communities employ a system of smaller churches that serve neighborhoods or districts of said community

## National Significance: 
The [[Telor|Teloric]] government's claim to rule is entirely based in Focalism and its connection to [[Tel'Voric]] as its founder and shepherd

The governments hierarchy and bureaucracy is based and exists as part of the hierarchy of the [[Violet Church]]. 

The core values and pursuits of the [[Telor|Teloric]] people are founded in focalist ideology.  Public opinion hinges on ones adherence to these tenants. Sins like destruction of information will bring the ire of every citizen, and at times, the populous will support scholars and sorcerers against their better judgment.

## Institution
[[Violet Church]]
-   The seat of Focalism's power is the [[Violet Church]], an institution that sits within the smoking crater of they [[Amethyst City]]. It serves as great university especially known for magical research. 
-   The high sage of the violet church is the point of focalist leadership and maintains a class of pupils who serve as an advisory council 
-   Until very recently its reputation was somewhat besmirched with its closure by Jondal [[Voral Dynasty|Voral]]
[[The Ascendant Halls]]: Home to what many believe is the site of [[Tel'Voric]] accession to godhood, the ascendant halls lie on the border of the first and second tier of [[Telor|Telor's]] capital city, [[Vorvelal]].

## Pilgrimage 
-   Many choose to make their way to the [[Violet Church]] as it is said one experiences heightened connection to [[Tel'Voric]] there.
-   Information and book trade is conducted through great [[Teloric Caravans|caravans]] that travel from city to city and town to town. They set up great markets, buying and selling the wares and products of focus from a given town.
-   Most pilgrims join these [[Teloric Caravans|caravans]] and work their way to the [[Violet Church]] or a [[Trains|Train]] that will take them there, provided they have the funds.
