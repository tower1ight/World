Early Life:



  The circumstances of Tal’s birth were as simple as they were irrelevant. Her mother and father had been children themselves when they had the misfortune of getting pregnant, both unable and unwilling to take on the burden of a newborn child. With no family to raise her, Tal was left, rather unceremoniously, in the care of a cloistered nunnery in a nearby village. Unbeknownst to her parents, they had committed Tal to a life of monotony and religious servitude. The Ladies of Lilac, an extremist sect of the Violet Church, frequently accepted orphaned children to supplement their numbers and, thus, Tal was named and raised within the bounds of their order. The nunnery was a silent and sparingly decorated fortress where pious followers of Teloric religion dedicated themselves to individual and focused worship. Bare walls and sullen corners were all Tal knew until she grew tall enough to peer through the high windows. What she saw beyond the castle’s bounds shocked and transfixed her.

 The world outside was bursting with color, excitement, and goods beyond belief – lustrous fabrics, radiant gems, fantastical contraptions. Tal had never seen such beauty. In a single instant, her gray life was spoiled. At every free opportunity, she would sneak a peek through the windows and imagine another life for herself, one of grandeur and opulence. The nuns discouraged this type of behavior of course, disparaging outsiders as greedy and misguided fools who had lost sight of the true worship of Telor. Knowing that yearning for the outside world would only bring her pain and pariahship from the other children, Tal hid her unique proclivities and developed a talent for going unnoticed. She would sneak from her chambers in the middle of the night and escape into the raucous town, at first only to observe, but after a time, to participate as well. Only her best friend Marge (Margie) knew of this illicit behavior. Tal and Margie had been delivered to the Ladies of Lilac on the same evening and had been inseparable ever since. Together, they would creep about the castle and discuss the lives they might have outside its walls. Margie was afraid of engaging with the caravans at first, but in Tal’s confident company, risk became easier.

   On the night before their initiation, Tal made a choice that would change her life forever. At 17, she turned her back on the Ladies of Lilac and their stoic ways, embracing the exuberance and materiality of the caravans she had grown to love. Tal pleaded with Margie to join her, but she steadfastly refused. Tal had always been the outgoing one for whom the silent halls chaffed; however, Margie found peace and comfort in her religious surroundings. For the two girls who had never spent more than 24 hours apart, separation was heartbreak. As their paths diverged, they swore an oath to never forget the other and once Tal had snuck her way onto the departing textile cart, she spent her first night of freedom memorizing Margie’s smile.

Life in the Caravan:

At first, Poxy, the textile merchant, didn’t know what to make of the girl passed out among the fabric rolls. She looked healthy enough, but was hideously dressed in a gray, shapeless frock that did nothing to accentuate the curves underneath.

-       Tal wakes up and confidently states her intention to join the caravan as an apprentice

-       Poxy takes pity of Tal and sees this as an opportunity to get a little unpaid labor, hires her on

-       For the first time in her life, Tal gets to choose how she wants to dress and present herself to the world

-       Poxy (Helena Bonham Carter vibes) is not a mother figure for her, rather like a fun aunt

-       Tal spends 3 years on the caravan (ages 17-20) travelling around the world and learning about other cultures/training to fit in everywhere

-       The caravan exposes Tal to beauty, both natural and made, but doesn’t allow her to build any wealth of her own

Life in the City:

-       Tal leaves the caravan once they arrive in the city and begins work as an assistant in the small house that operates the textile cart

-       The work is boring and fulfils none of the ideas of beauty and wealth that Tal had initially imagined for herself

-       When a competing house offers her a load of money to act as their spy within her current house, Tal leaps at the opportunity even though she knows it is a betrayal of Poxy’s trust (she sees this as something that won’t hurt Poxy more than it benefits herself)

-       Competing house buys the house that Tal worked for and continues to fund her skills as a spy

-       Over the years, Tal becomes a highly skilled agent of corporate espionage and sabotage

-       The house she works for gets a little too big for their britches and sends her to spy on Follanel, Tal uses the opportunity to sell her services to Follanel instead

-       Follanel sets her up as a socialite, enough money and status to get into the room, but not enough to cause significant notice, she’s just one of the many rich characters in the city

-       Tal works as a spy because it allows her access to money, power, glamor, and excitement

o   She is also now deeply in the pocket of Follanel

Mission:

-       Stated reason –

o   I’m pretending that I owe money to Follanel and am on this prison cart as a debtor

§  Partying socialite that overshot her funds

-       Real reason –

o   I’m going to this new land as an operative of Follanel in order to secure the acquisition of Gloria’s company

-       Personal reason(s) –

o   Chasing freedom, chasing beauty, chasing COLOR

o   I want that feeling that I first had when I looked out the window of the convent, the feeling I had when I joined the caravan

o   I’m abandoning a lot of the wealth I’ve gained in Telor, but I’m betting I’ll find a way to make more in the new world

Character Traits:

-       Secretive

-       Good at sneaking

-       Charismatic and charming (when necessary)

-       Flirtatious (as a distraction)

-       Confident

-       Searching for wonder and beauty

-       Allegiance to myself and my desires

Things Tal knows:

-       The map of Telor

-       Customs of the cultures around the continent

-       Who is Gloria, what is her company, etc.

-       Who are the higher ups in Follanel

Ladies of Lilac:

-       Medical institution – unmatched in healing

-       Level of separation from politics and surrounding town

-       Very religious – detachment from material plane
