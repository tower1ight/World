 # what is it


 **

“...and the Wandering Merchant, with great fatigue and injury, made his final stop along the crossroads. Sorrow and pride entered into his heart at once with the acceptance that this glittering, emerald jungle would be the last of the great big world he would never get to see. Through his blurring vision, he makes out a thicket of mostly elevated roots that would make for a fine deathbed. He stumbled over the uneven terrain, the weight of a wondrous century on his back. The worn fabric of his soles slipped beneath him, and the old merchant finally buckled over into the canopy floor. Unable to stand, he slips off the heavy trunks and bags behind him and props himself along the trunk of a great big tree. He begins to sort through his belongings, pulling out the engraved gourd gifted to him at his last visit to the old city cistern. He wondered if anyone would miss this collection of trinkets and oddities besides him.

  

It had been months since his last encounter with man. Nature seemed to want him here and would not let him go. As he drank, his mind wandered to the place of dreams. Thoughts of home came to him, and with that came the echoes of warning from those who would have kept him from taking this journey. All the warnings he was given, about the dangers of the untrodden road and the unforgiving tendencies of the natural world. The thick jungle heat burns his eyes shut and his bones ache for a touch of kindness. He digs through the record of his memory, thinking back to why he started this journey into the unknown. But the fatigue overcomes him, and the man falls to his side with a heavy release of his weight into the jungle floor.

  

In the last moments of fading consciousness, under the shaded canopy, the merchant lay his head at the foot of an old tree. He lay silently, awaiting the last gasp of life to escape from his chest beneath him. Suddenly, an avian creature of the corvid variety found itself perched in perfect view of the fallen merchant. Surely this was a companion of death, here to lead him along his journey to the next world. It examined the pile of luggage it was perched upon, pecking through the assortment of goods with much curiosity. It moves to the merchant's hands, which had already begun to go cold.

  

The crow appeared to also thirst for the contents of the gourd but its beak could not open its stopper. The old merchant, in a final moment of kindness, mustard the meager strength to raise his arm and undo its cloth fastings before falling limp once again. The crow went to drink but was unable to reach the bottom of the half-empty receptacle. Some time passed before it gave up its attempt and it flew away, only to quickly return with a smooth stone in its mouth. It went to place the stone into the gourd and flew away again, coming again with another stone to repeat the procedure. A few moments after, the merchant watched happily as the clever crow drank its fill of the stone-filled gourd. The crow looked up to the old man, with the glint of curiosity in its eyes. It flew away once again, returning this time with another stone. The stone, however, was different from the last. It glowed a verdant, reflective green and held within it a beautiful pattern of smooth, aged mineral. The crow moved to place the green stone in the hand of the dying merchant before flying away. All of a sudden, it became clear once again why he began this journey. The corner of his lips pulled apart into a great smile. He took one last inhalation, one last moment to appreciate the sweetness of the wind that carried him here before passing into the next world…”

-Tales of a Merchant, Q

Act 1: The Crow and the Perfumer

  

“Wandering Merchant...Visit to the old City… Encounter with Man…” I repeat the prepared phrase again with enthusiasm hoping this time it will work. I arrived at the new settlement outside of the jungle clearing a few days ago. Just like in the town many leagues away, I am unable to relieve my wares. The armed men who are stationed here do not trust me it would seem. I hear the harshness of their voices. It's a tone I am not familiar with. When I overheard these words, it was always done with a soft enthusiasm that invited the ear to slumber and rest. These men are vulgar with their speech, but still, I must listen. 

  

“We’ve already told you that you don’t have the right permits to carry that much inventory through this entrance. And could you please stop talking like that?” shoots back one of the guards with wavering patience.

  

“Are you with any merchant house? Caravan?” the other guard asks. These words were new and exciting. I watched them for so long before I knew they even had a name. I remember sitting on the hill overlooking the iron roots and waiting for the metal carriages to pass by. They always carried such wonderful goods from outside the region. Sometimes, I would sneak closer and listen to the merchants speak about the tales of their journeys. So many places and so many languages. I knew I had to see it all for myself.

  

“...merchant house…Caravan? The place of dreams…if anyone would miss this collection of trinkets and oddities…the weight of a wondrous century”.

  

A new combination, hopefully, better explaining the reason for my visit. I am a merchant and I wish to travel with the caravan. I have always dreamed of an opportunity like this and I’ve prepared for many moons to finally take the journey into the world of man. I’ve listened to their stories and browsed their wares from afar, but I must now seek them out personally. Their world is full of such beauty and mystery and I must know more!

  

“What the fuck… are you reciting poetry or something? Get the hell out of here before we gotta kick you out ourselves!”

  

The guards hike up their long weapons to push me away. Have I offended them? This must have been a miscommunication. These words have failed me yet again. I try to gesture my intentions but it seems to only upset them further. The two guards reach to grab me as another group of men rush over and confiscate my wares. The heavy trodding of their voice is unpleasant and I struggle to think of what to say to them…

  

“So foul and fair a day I have not seen.”

  

Suddenly, the world stopped and it felt as if the sky and earth were taken hostage by the sound of soft thunder. Such a sharp yet delicate dance upon the wind. The iron and red tones bounce to the marching rhythm of a world consuming itself. I’ve never heard words as tragic and beautiful as these. No such moment in time before this have I felt like I have heard the voice of God.

Is this what men referred to as “Focus”? 

  

Before I could recover from the sonic euphoria, the men were gone and my belongings lay at the feet of whatever sourced those beautiful words. I brought up my gaze, astonished to discover that though these were the words of man, the one reciting resembled a creature like myself. Sharp black talons layered beneath fine leather and silk. Tufts of white silver tucked beneath embellished fabrics and glittering green jewels. A mighty aura of one well seasoned with travel and trade. A merchant for sure, but one I’ve never seen before. They extend aid to assist me from the floor. As I rise to stand, I know for once the exact words to say:

  

“Surely this was a companion of death, here to lead him along his journey to the next world”

  

Act 2: Très Gourmand

  

Sounds of steel screeches against the rusted unkempt station. It would seem no one has made their way this far into the Riverland in a while. Lucky for us, it only took a bit of convincing with the conductor to move around their trade schedule to make a quick pit stop outside their route.

  

“If money go before, all ways do lie open”

  

That was one of the first lessons taught to me as a merchant. In this world, men speak not in Common but in amounts of gold and platinum. A simpler language I much prefer to the rules of grammar and syntax. Still, the orators and librarians I’ve met under my apprenticeship have helped me learn to get by thus far.

  

I look out the window and see the dwarven engineers at work. Their banter is gritty, their conversations like tumbling boulders or the rumble of empty caverns. A most fascinating culture, their mastery of the forge is so inspiring. Truly a gift to this world to have such machines which make travel effortless.

  

Across from my seat lay a sleeping giant of a man. Floyd was a retired militia man who now works freelance security contracting jobs. He’s not one for conversation, unfortunately, but that’s not why I hired him.  Reports have it that there have been a string of incidents in this area surrounding lost cargo along usually safe trade routes. He’s a reliable fighter who has worked with our house for a while now so I know I can trust him as a personal guard.

  

Some time passes, and the door to my coach opens. A dwarf, the one that I had spoken with before boarding this train, walks in with a stack of parchment. He must be here to collect…

  

“Alright then, the trains are being prepped to turn around. Are you sure you want to be left out here? This station has been out of commission for many months now and there aren't any caravan routes planned to come through for at least another week or two. I’d hate for a fellow like yourself to go and die out here with all your… goods.”

  

He looks around briefly before sliding a note from between the stack of papers, and an “invoice” for 30 gold pieces. This trip would end up costing us about two weeks’ worth of sales, but I knew it was worth the expense. Because of incidents, the flow of commerce has slowed dramatically and our supply of the local fauna used in our most popular product has dried up. If I could figure out the cause of the disturbance, I’m sure it would fare well for our ledgers.

  

I pull out the gold from my purse and place it in the now extended hand. The dwarf pockets the money quickly and turns to exit from the coach. I reach for my pack above my seat and take stock of my wares. As I rummage through, Floyd awakes with a great stretch and yawn.

  

“Really couldn't afford first-class time Poe? These benches are killer on my back”

  

An attempt at sarcasm I assume, he knows how tight the budget is for this project. Especially with how much his rates went up conveniently as soon as we asked him to accompany me. 

  

“He that sleeps feels not the tooth-ache”, I reply in response. I am grateful for his security, but there is nothing I can do about the lack of comfort. Soon we would hopefully be in the comfort of familiar company. Derek, our halfling contact in this area and longtime partner, is usually always amiable to our needs and would shelter us. Correspondence has been slow due to the incidents. Hopefully, he could share more information on the matter. 

  

Floyd and I walk the path out of the station and the sounds of heavy metal and steam eventually disappear behind us. By the time we arrived at the town Derek had been staying at, the sun had begun to set. Strangely, there were no guards or militiamen to greet us. Even stranger was the fact that windows and doors were open with no lights on or people inside. There was a deafening silence as we walked through the empty street, and as we approached Derek’s storefront, I was aware of the smell of death…

  

“It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it was blood.” I signal to Floyd to draw his weapon. The scent was dried but we must still be cautious of whatever might have caused it. He takes point as we enter through the open doors. Inside the dark room was a horrible scene. Broken furniture. Ripped fabrics. Shattered glass. A case of our fragrances had been spilled across the front counter, and there were subtle floral notes masked beneath the now-pungent smell of blood. I look over and find its source. The corpse of the young halfling child who attended the counter was on the floor. The poor boy seemed to have been mangled to death by some strange beast. I step back, the nausea of the smell causing me to lose my balance. Floyd steps behind to catch my weight and gives me a reassuring nod before returning me to my feet. He hops over the counter with his shortsword at the ready, pushing through the door leading to the stock rooms in the back. I come to my senses and reach for the dagger at my side to follow behind. 

The fading twilight from the previous room was absent here and it was almost completely dark. I twist and reach for the tinderbox in my bag and within a few moments I was able to illuminate the space with some spare candles lying nearby. Nothing seemed to come out of the darkness until we reached the back corner of the room where Derek lay unresponsive. 

Something was off about him. He looked unharmed, but there was something else there too. A strange fragrance seemed to linger in the air around him. Usually, he smelled of heat and amber, the profile that was custom to people in this region. But his scent now was sweet, almost edible. On top of that, he seemed to be wearing a strange garment in a style that seemed to suggest that of classical halfling garbs of the previous century.

  

As I observe from afar, Floyd moves forward with caution to investigate Derek's body. He pokes him first with the tip of his sword and no response is given. He placed his sword down and moved closer to check for signs of life. At that moment, the air mixed and the smell of the room went sour. Before I could warn him, Floyd had been pulled into the fabrics of Derek’s clothing. He tried to pull away for a moment before the fabric opened up again to reveal a set of glowing eyes and razor teeth which sunk into Floyd’s shoulder as he screamed. I ran to him and tried to pull him free, but these monstrous fabrics seemed strong beyond comprehension. A moment of struggle ensued before Floyd’s screaming reached its climax and his arm came removed from his body. He falls to the floor, writhing in pain, and I try to pull him out of the stock room with much difficulty and effort. I look up at the chewing fabrics which have moved away to reveal Derek’s half-skeleton corpse. It moves closer quickly as Floyd and I attempt to stumble out of the storeroom. 

  

We make it to the front door of the store before, we are both pulled back into the darkness with a great force. The creature hidden in the fabrics had wrapped itself around our torsos and the pressure of its grip began to constrict around us. We struggle to free ourselves to no avail, and soon Floyd’s attempts stop entirely as he fades to unconsciousness from blood loss. I muster the strength to free my arm and begin hacking away at the fabrics with my dagger. In response, they seem to squeeze even tighter around me and the pain causes me to drop the weapon. I trash and bite as a last resort, feeling the grip of the monster grow even more painful.

In the chaos of the scene, I could hear the fragrance samples in my bag begin to shatter under the weight of the pressure and I could feel the glass cutting through into my back. An entire continent's worth of smells was released into enclosed space. The memory of all the scents I’ve collected comes back to me, and my mind begins to drift blissfully to unconsciousness. Before that, however, the grip around me seemed to loosen a bit. Instead of a firm hold, it felt like the fabrics were slipping softly around me, almost like a warm embrace. Suddenly, the fabrics seemed to begin to morph shape and color and in a few moments, the traveler's cloak I was wearing transformed into a beautiful bundle of flowing clothes and silks. The intricate design seemed to ebb and flow within itself. Like a joyful, kaleidoscopic dance of some kind.

  

We sent a distress message using the scroll I kept for business orders. Just like the dwarf from the train had said, there was no caravan coming through for another 8 days. I explained to them that I discovered the source of the incidents and that they wouldn’t have to worry about more incidents for a while. However, I didn’t tell them about the fabrics that were still on my person. Floyd, thanks to the last of the medicines I carried, survived his injury. Still, the pain remained, as did the rage. He wished to slay the beast which wrapped around my neck. To his disappointment, our contract forbids him from tampering with the merchandise I carry. I feel a strange connection to these fabrics. They are a beast like I, one who wishes to experience the world of man. To Floyd’s protest on the matter, I simply reply:

  

“If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?”

  

Act 3: The House of Usher

  

Moonlight reflects through the painted glass windows lining the office. Beneath us, the city moves quietly through the motions. Blacksmiths smother out the roaring fires of their forge, and craftsmen count slowly the stock they made and sold today. Stalls are closed and streets are swept in preparation for the morning where it all begins again. 

  

I sit across from Usher, who twirls and taps his pen as he often does while reading paperwork. It was a trick he taught me when I first learned the common tongue. It helps to keep a rhythm when you can’t speak the words aloud. Gourmand lies dormant on the coat rack, his pattern moving through a collection of spirals and pastel washes. His mind must still be on the boat we just got off after our trip to the Isles.

  

It’s been a while since I made a visit to the house. Business seems to be going well in my absence. While I was training, I would run up and down this house attending to almost all the business needs. Sorting through correspondence, preparing orders for parcel deliveries, and of course helping Usher with anything he needed. After a while, the house grew and we were finally able to hire some employees to help out. It was incredibly helpful when Sasha joined our team. Once my training was complete, she oversaw most of the operational needs that I left. 

  

She was the one who sent the message to come home immediately. She said that Usher had urgent news that needed to be shared with me. This was most strange since Usher usually would mail his own letters to me. He has never approved of using one of our scrolls to send simple messages such as this so I knew there was something important. 

  

When Sasha sent the message, she mentioned that Usher had been in worse health as of late. It wasn’t until I saw him personally that I understood how dire the situation was. The timbre of his voice seemed less dynamic, almost as if it was failing. As he twirled his pen, I could see a slight shakiness in his grip.

  

He notices my concern and gives a faint smile before standing and turning towards the window overlooking the city streets. As he stands there, the moonlight shines softly over the white tuft of fading silver beneath his undercoat.

  

He took a breath and began to recite an old poem:

  

GAILY bedight,

        A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

        Had journeyed long,

        Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.

  

        But he grew old --

        This knight so bold --

And o'er his heart a shadow

        Fell as he found

        No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.

  

I knew this poem well. It was one of the first pieces of the common language he taught to me. The story of the lost ancient city, of treasure untold. I dreamed so often of visiting this place, but no such place existed on any of his maps. As a young fledgling, Usher had similar dreams too. It was the reason he started this merchant house. He found such beauty in the art of perfumery and he made it his life’s purpose to explore, to understand how the distant winds achieved their scents. Whenever I asked him what Eldorado smelled like, he never had the answer. I sit up and reply with a piece of wisdom he had shared with me:

  

“Ignorance is the curse of God; knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven”

  

We both chuckle, remembering how long it took me to memorize that line. I would repeat all through the day as I completed my apprenticeship. He looks back at me and proceeds with the rest of the poem: 

  

        And, as his strength

        Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow --

        "Shadow," said he,

        "Where can it be --

This land of Eldorado?"

  

As I listen quietly, he reaches back to his desk to the stack of papers he was working on before I came in. He picks them up and hands them to me to read. The header of the page is stamped with the mark of Follanel. One of the most well established luxury houses in Vorvelal has written to us? I skim briskly through the papers for more details. It appears to be a contract detailing an invitation to a trip through the Ammolite Veil. Such a notion was unfathomable! No one has ever returned from the veil and lived to tell of their journey. Even the price they ask for in monetary buy-in is far beyond what anyone in this company could rightfully pay.

  

I look up to Usher for an explanation, and he replies with a somber tone:

  

    "Over the Mountains

        Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

        Ride, boldly ride,"

        The shade replied, --

"If you seek for Eldorado!”

  

He intends to travel through the veil? In his condition? I stop reading and put the papers down. I try to convince him to reconsider but he stops me with a gesture of his hand. He reaches to his breast and pulls from around his neck a leather cord revealing a glittering jade stone. He removes the tie and goes to fit it around my neck before turning back towards his desk to sign the contract. I know at that moment what he is asking to be done. His old body is no longer fit to make the journey to Eldorado. He’s passed on the task to me…

  

“Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.”

  

He speaks one last verse of wisdom as a start for the door. I dare not turn around now lest I lose the newly found resolve I have been granted. I grab the signed papers and don Gourmand who still lies asleep on the coat rack. I close the door behind me and make my way out of the house. Without another word, I make my way briskly to the steps of Follanel, ready to begin my next journey.
