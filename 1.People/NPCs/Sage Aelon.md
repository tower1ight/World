 # Summary
 ## Visual description
 ## Who are they


Some find her callus, disloyal, calculating and they might be right but the word misses any nuance and reduces one to sentimentality alone. This is to say the worth can be more than their commitment to moral truths that bend to whoever is most charismatic. She realized long ago that she would reach her goals far more consistently if she tossed them asside  

She yerns for a time when she was pushing the boundaries of the arcane, growing up in the [[Violet Church]] under [[Marge Vaginopolis|Marge's]] tuttilage, now 30 years removed from her focal group she holds a station out of responsibility and hope for her friend. Her faith that marge will pull out of this sopiral is waning, so she has  and she is in charge of an insubordinate camp immersed in the kind of project she had always dreamed of, unable to move, stalled by a commitment to thwart marge

She summoned the prisoners, hand pickled them to cause as much trouble as possible and hold the invasion force back as long as she can, she loathed to leave but will do anything she needs to to keep marge from the [[Prism]]

what does she like 
- when you simply obey


Im salivating at the prospect of knowing this place, for five long years ive delayed gratification, its almost in my grasp and soon ill leave this place, months and ill be free! finally done with stalling and delaying this godforsaken invasion. The warforged will take my place but by then it will be too late. I can make my escape and know that I have done what i can, lost as many soliders as i could, given the goblins as much information as they need to cripple our assualt! Turning my attention back to my desk my eyes drift over to a picture of her, her, for the 800th time i rue the day I met that witch. the sharp crook of her nose so cruel and demanding, so infuriating so fiucking lost. WHy  why whhy does she need this, and why cant i let her have it.
