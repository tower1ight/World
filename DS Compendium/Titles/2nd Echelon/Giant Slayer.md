# Giant Slayer

*"Come back here, puny one, and let me crush you!"* **Prerequisites:** You defeat a leader or solo monster with the Giant keyword, such as a fire giant chief.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Smallfolk Dodge:** Creatures of size 2 or larger take a bane on attacks against you.

- **Up the Beanstalk:** You gain the Climb skill. If you already have this skill, you gain an edge on tests made with the Climb skill instead. While you are climbing a creature, the creature has a double bane on strikes against you and you have a double edge on tests made to stay on the creature.

- **The Harder they Fall:** You gain the The Harder They Fall ability, which can be paid for using the heroic resource of your class:
