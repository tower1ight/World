# Heist Hero

*"Everybody know their assignments? Alright, let's go."* **Prerequisites:** You have the [[Troupe Tactics]] title, and you used planning and [[Teamwork|teamwork]] to execute a theft that went (reasonably) according to plan.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Mother Hen:** As part of a 10-minute focusing ritual, you can psionically enhance up to five willing creatures within 10 squares of you who can speak and understand a language that you know. For the next hour, you and each target can communicate telepathically with each other, no matter the distance between you.
- **Sneakers:** You gain the Sneak skill. If you already have the Sneak skill, you gain an edge on tests made with the Sneak skill. During a group test, you can both use the Sneak skill and assist another hero using the Sneak skill.
- **Timely Distraction:** You gain the Timely Distraction triggered action:

## Timely Distraction

*Coming through with hot soup! I better watch out for that banana peel!*

**Trigger:** An ally makes a test to lie to, pickpocket, [[Hide|hide]] from, or sneak by a creature within distance and doesn't like the result

**Effect:** You momentarily attract the creature's notice. Your ally can reroll their test. Once you have used Timely Distraction, you can't use it again on the same creature for at least 1 hour.
