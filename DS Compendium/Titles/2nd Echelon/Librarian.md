# Librarian

*"You want to know the exact coordinates of the Gem of the Waves shipwreck? I came across that just the other day in an unpublished memoir of its second mate. Let me get that for you."*

**Prerequisites:** You have the [[Ancient Loremaster]] title, and you have completed a Discover Lore project to learn lost knowledge or forbidden knowledge.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Arcane Improvisation:** When you use a damagedealing Signature Ability with the Magic keyword, you can change one of its damage types to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage.
- **I Have Just the Book:** If you start a Discover Lore project in your stronghold, you instantly gain 60 points towards the completion of that project. If the project costs 60 or fewer points, you complete it in 10 minutes without needing to use a respite activity.
- **Picked Up a Few Things:** You learn a skill from the Lore skill group.
- **Polyglot:** You learn two languages. Additionally, the Project Goal for the Learn New Language project is halved for you.
