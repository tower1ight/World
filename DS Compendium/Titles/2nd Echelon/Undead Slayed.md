# Undead Slayed

*"No I didn't get bitten, and yes I'm fine!"*

**Prerequisites:** You are killed by an undead creature.

You return to life 1 minute after being killed, with Stamina equal to your winded value. You gain corruption immunity equal to your level and a benefit listed below based on the creature who killed you. If you die again, you rise as an undead monster under the Director's control.

- **[[Ghoul]] or Vampire:** When you make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against an adjacent creature, you can make it a bite and gain temporary Stamina equal to the damage you dealt.
- **Incorporeal Undead:** You can move through other creatures and objects at normal speed. The first time in a round that you pass through a creature, that creature takes corruption damage equal to half your level. You don't take damage from being force moved into objects.
- **Other Corporeal Undead:** When you are reduced to Stamina 0 by damage that isn't fire damage or holy damage and your body isn't destroyed, you regain half your Stamina and fall [[Prone|prone]]. Once you have used this benefit once, you can't do so again until you earn 10 Victories.
