# Arena Fighter

*"You've never seen the Showstopper? The move so brutal that it was banned in the Arena? Come closer and I'll show it to you."*

**Prerequisites:** You earn public victory in battle in an arena or other contest.

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **Dirty Fighting:** While standing, you gain a +3 damage bonus on melee strikes against [[Prone|prone]] creatures, and being [[Prone|prone]] doesn't impose a bane on your strikes.
- **Foes as Weapons:** While you have a creature [[Grabbed|grabbed]], you can use your action to make a melee weapon [[Free Strike|free strike]]. Both the target and the [[Grabbed|grabbed]] enemy take the strike's damage. The [[Grab|grab]] then ends.
- **Instant Celebrity:** You gain 1 Renown.
- **Showstopper:** You gain the Showstopper ability, which can be paid for using the heroic resource of your class:
