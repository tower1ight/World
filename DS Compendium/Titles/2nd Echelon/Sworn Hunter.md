# Sworn Hunter

*"I will follow you to the ends of the earth just so I can kick you off the edge."*

**Prerequisites:** You have the [[Marshal]] title, and you take down an entire [[Criminal|criminal]] organization.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **[[Hunter]]'s Oath:** As an action, you can swear a [[Hunter|hunter]]'s oath against a creature within 10 squares you have line of effect on. This oath lasts until the target dies or until you swear a [[Hunter|hunter]]'s oath against a different creature. As long as the [[Hunter|hunter]]'s oath lasts, you magically know the direction of the target if it is within 50 miles of you, and you have a +5 damage bonus on abilities made against the creature.
- **Particular Set of Skills:** You learn a skill from the intrigue skill group.
- **We're In This Together:** When you have a creature [[Grabbed|grabbed]] and take damage from an ability not used by that creature, the [[Grabbed|grabbed]] creature takes the same damage.
