# Special Agent

*"And this is interesting ... if you twist the third button on your overcoat--no, don't do it now!"*

**Prerequisites:** A spymaster gives you an important secret mission.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Boffin:** You gain a small magical spy device called a boffin. Once per encounter, you can activate a boffin property (see Boffin Properties) as a maneuver.
- **Caustic Alchemy:** You gain your choice of Coat the Blade or Smoke Bomb from the Shadow 1st-level college features. When you use this feature, you can't spend Insight unless you have the Insight class feature.
- **Spy Ring:** You gain a piece of magical jewelry, such as a ring. While wearing the ring, you take on the illusory appearance of an individual you can see within 10 squares of you as an action. This disguise lets you automatically succeed on tests made with the Disguise skill based solely on visual identification.

## Boffin Properties

You can use the following boffin properties as a maneuver with the Boffin benefit:

- Make a test that uses the Disguise skill with an edge.
- A [[Mundane|mundane]] lock you are touching is unlocked.
- Choose a square within 10 spaces of you. You don't need line of effect to the space. You can hear as if you were standing in that square.
- You throw the boffin up to 10 squares, where it explodes in a 5 cube. Each creature in the area takes fire damage equal to 2d10 + your level. The boffin is permanently destroyed (but may be replaced by your spymaster ... though they don't like doing it often).
