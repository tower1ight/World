# Blood Magic

*"Flow, blood, thou fiend's libation, and catch my foes in conflagration!"*

**Prerequisites:** You participate in a Discover Lore project to learn forbidden lore.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Blood Mage:** When you use an area ability with the Psionic or Magic keyword, you can deal yourself damage equal to your level, which can't be reduced in any way, to increase the ability's area by 1. You can only use this benefit once per ability.
- **Bloody Murder:** When you deal damage to a creature with a strike, you can deal yourself damage equal to your level, which can't be prevented in any way, to deal twice that much corruption damage to the creature. You can only use this benefit once per ability. If the creature is reduced to 0 Stamina by this corruption damage, the creature explodes in a shower of blood and you regain the Stamina you lost. You can't use this benefit on creatures without blood, such as constructs, elementals, and undead.
- **I Reject This Evil Power!** You gain corruption immunity equal to your level.
