# Faction Officer

*"If there's something you want talk to me. I have a certain amount of ... influence in these parts."*

**Prerequisite:** You have the [[Faction Member]] title, and you greatly [[Advance|advance]] the faction's goals.

You are given a position of great authority within your faction.

You gain both of the following benefits:

- **You're the Boss:** Lower-ranking members of your faction follow your routine orders. In non-routine matters, you gain an edge on tests made to influence their behavior.
- **Requisition:** When you gain this title, you gain a 1st or 2nd echelon magic trinket of your choice from your faction (see Treasures). Whenever you gain a level, you can swap it out for another trinket.
