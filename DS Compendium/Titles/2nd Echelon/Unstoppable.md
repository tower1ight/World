# Unstoppable

*"I seen the goblin king run 'im through with a spear. Then I seen 'im pull 'imself back up, spear still in 'im, and headbutt the goblin king ... then he pulls out the spear and throws it on the goblin king's corpse."*

**Prerequisites:** A hero defeats a foe while at or below 0 Stamina.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **From Hell's Heart:** While winded, your melee strikes deal an additional 3 damage.
- **Furious Attack:** Choose one signature ability from the Fury class. You gain that ability even if you don't meet its prerequisites. When you use abilities gained from this title, you can't gain or spend Rage unless you have the Rage class feature.
- **Furious [[Charge]]:** When you use the [[Charge]] action, your melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] deals extra damage equal to the number of squares you moved as part of the [[Charge|charge]].
