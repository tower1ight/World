# Godsworn

*"He seemed like he needed help! Now the dead speak to me. I think maybe that old man was more than he seemed."*

**Prerequisites:** You do a favor for an [[Agent|agent]] of a deity or saint or promise to do so.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Healing Gift:** You can use the Conduit Healing Grace feature as if you had spent 1 piety. You can't use this feature again until you earn at least 1 Victory.
- **Last-Ditch Prayer:** On your turn, you can use a free maneuver to recite a prayer for help. You gain 2d10 Heroic Resources granted by your class. These heroic resources disappear at the end of your turn if you haven't spent them. Once this ability is used, you can't use it again until you perform another service for the deity or gain a level.
- **Touched by the God:** Choose a deity or saint from the Conduit Deity and Domains table. From their list of domains, choose a Conduit 1st-level domain feature.
