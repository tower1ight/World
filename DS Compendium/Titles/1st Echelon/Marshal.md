# Marshal

*"I said you had 24 hours to leave town. That*

*was...what, about 24 hours ago?"*

**Prerequisites:** You join an organization, such as the Far Mariners, that hunts [[Criminal|criminals]], or you are deputized to act for the local authorities.

Chooses one of the following benefits:

- **I Guess It's the Hard Way:** When a combat begins and you are not surprised, the first time you take damage before your turn you halve that damage.
- **Heedless Pursuer:** Once on your turn, you can spend 1d6 stamina as a free maneuver. If you do so, you ignore [[Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] and the length of your [[Jump|jumps]] increases by 1 square until the end of your turn.
- **Silver Shield:** You have a badge granted to you by your organization. While you are wearing it, you gain the Divine Interdiction feature from the My Life for Yours class. When you use this feature in this way, you can't spend wrath unless you have the Wrath class feature.
- **Trained Tracker:** You gain an edge on tests made to track [[Criminal|criminals]].
