# Presumed Dead

*"But... you're dead. We went to your funeral."* **Prerequisites:** You die in a way that prevents your body from being recovered or examined (for instance, you fall off a cliff).

While it may appear that you died, in fact you did not. You regain 1 Stamina and can spend one or more Recoveries. In addition, you gain a 1st-echelon trinket of the Director's choice.

At a dramatic moment determined by the Director, you rejoin your party with an explanation for your narrow escape, and how you found your new trinket along the way.
