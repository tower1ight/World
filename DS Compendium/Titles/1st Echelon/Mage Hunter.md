# Mage Hunter

*"Their power is dangerous. Unnatural. Someone needs to do something."*

**Prerequisites:** You defeat three leaders or solo monsters who could each use at least one ability with the Magic keyword.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Arcane Dampening:** Your characteristic scores are considered 1 higher when resisting potencies from magic abilities.
- **Oh No You Don't!** When an adjacent creature uses an ability with the Magic keyword, you can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against them as a triggered action.
- **Stink of Magic:** As a maneuver, you can open your senses to the residue of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you are aware whether each creature within 5 squares of you is an undead, construct, or creature from another plane of existence, and whether they have used an ability with the Magic keyword in the past hour. Additionally, you never suffer the penalties of being surprised by undead, constructs, or creatures from another plane of existence.
