# Owed A Favor

*"The Guild's gratitude knows no bounds! We'll repay you in any way we can ... short of actually paying you."* **Prerequisites:** You successfully perform a service for a powerful faction.

The faction will perform one favor for the party, provided it doesn't interfere with the faction's goals.

Additionally, the faction is a good source of information. The Director chooses a skill from the crafting or lore skill groups appropriate to the faction, such as the [[Criminal]] Underworld skill for an [[Outlaw|outlaw]] gang, the Blacksmith skill for a blacksmith's guild, or the Society skill for a [[Noble|noble]] house. While in a settlement with the faction, you gain this skill if you don't already have it. If you already have the skill, they gain an edge on tests made with the skill.
