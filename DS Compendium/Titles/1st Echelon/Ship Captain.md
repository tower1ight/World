# Ship Captain

*"Up anchor, shipmates, 'tisn't gold but glory we seek!"* **Prerequisites:** You acquire a ship, airship, or similar vessel.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Deep Sea Diver:** Your movement gains the Swim keyword.
- **Ship Speaker:** You magically know any of your ships' locations even while not aboard. You can telepathically speak to anyone on board the ship who understands a language, and they can respond, no matter your distance from the ship.
- **Signal Flags:** While aboard a ship, you can communicate with and conduct negotiations with another ship up to 5 miles away, as long as you can both see each other. You have an edge on Presence tests made while negotiating in this way.
- **Trained Crewmember:** You gain an edge on tests made to handle sea or air vessels.
