# Ancient Loremaster

*"It's astonishing what you find in old books. Look at this, nearly complete schematics for a war automaton, gathering dust because nobody here reads Zaliac."* **Prerequisites:** You find a trove of forgotten books.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Leverage:** You learn a priceless secret. The Director chooses the type of person who would value this secret, usually a member of a particular faction, such as a Higaran [[Noble|noble]], or a type of person, such as a fence of stolen goods. When negotiating with this type of person, you can offer this secret. If they accept, you instantly raise their interest by 3. You can only share this secret once.
- **Rare Books:** You add rare, ancient books to your collection. When you make a project roll for a research project, you roll an additional 1d6 for each dead language you know.
- **Susurrus Codex:** You find a sinister book that whispers advice in a voice no one else can hear. As long as you follow all the book's advice, you gain an edge on Reason tests and a bane on Presence tests. You can stop following the book's advice at any time, but the book won't speak to you for the rest of the day.
