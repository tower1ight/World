# Battleaxe Diplomat

*"We seem to be equals in might and swordcraft. Perhaps we should bandy with words awhile instead."* **Prerequisites:** You gain the friendship or alliance of a creature you once battled.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Iron Hand in Velvet Glove:** The first time during a negotiation when you make a test that uses the Intimidate skill and don't make an argument that appeals to the NPC's pitfall, you don't lower the NPC's patience or interest no matter the outcome of the roll.
- **Truce!** You have a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start negotiation.
- **Warriors' Understanding:** You have an edge on Presence tests made to influence creatures who you fought against in combat encounters.
