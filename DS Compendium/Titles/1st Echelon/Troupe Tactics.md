# Troupe Tactics

*"We're actors! We're the opposite of people!"*

**Prerequisites:** The party has successfully performed as a troupe of actors, circus [[Performer|performers]], or other entertainers.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Flying Circus:** At any time during a willing adjacent ally's turn, you can use a triggered action to push them up to 2 squares if their size is the same as yours, or 4 squares if they are smaller. If this push causes the creature to fall, they can use their action or maneuver before they fall to reduce the height of the fall by 2.
- **Spotlight:** You magically cause a creature within 10 squares to shed light for 5 squares. The light lasts for 1 minute, until the creature is more than 10 squares away from you, or until you dismiss the effect (no action required). While illuminated, a creature can't sneak or [[Hide|hide]], has a bane on tests to perform an action secretly, and has an edge on tests made with the Lead, Music, and Perform skills.
- **Supporting Player:** You gain an edge on group tests using Presence and on tests made to assist another creature with a Presence test.
- **Work the Crowd:** While one of your allies is playing music or performing, you gain an edge on tests made to [[Hide|hide]], sneak, conceal objects, or pick pockets.
