# Brawler

*"We won't kill you. But you might wish we did."* **Prerequisites:** You triumph in battle without killing any of your foes.

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **Duck!** When an enemy strikes you while a second creature is flanking you, you can use a triggered action to redirect the strike against the second creature. You can't use this benefit again until you gain a Victory.
- **Furniture Fighter:** When you use a weapon ability with an improvised weapon or a weapon that is not part of your kit, the ability still benefits from your kit's melee weapon damage bonus.
- **Headbutter:** Your [[Free Strike|free strikes]] don't take a bane while you are grappled or [[Restrained|restrained]].
- **If I Wanted You Dead, You'd Be Dead:** Now and in future fights, when you defeat foes without any killing, you gain an edge on tests during negotiations with them.
