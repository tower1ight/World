# Zombie Slayer

*"Why won't you die! You've already done it once, you should be good at it by now!"*

**Prerequisites:** You defeat a leader or solo monster with the Undead keyword, such as a [[Ghost|ghost]].

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Blessed Weapons:** When you use an ability that deals damage that has no type, you can deal holy damage instead.
- **Divine Health:** You gain corruption immunity equal to your highest characteristic score. You can't be turned into an undead creature.
- **Holy Terror:** You gain the Holy Terror ability, which can be paid for using the heroic resource of your class:

## Costs 3 Heroic Resources: Holy Terror

*Return to your grave!*

| :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Area, Magic | **Type:** Maneuver      |
| **Distance:** 3 burst     | **Target:** All enemies |

**Effect:** Each undead creature in the area takes holy damage equal to your Reason, Intuition, or Presence score (your choice) and is **P \< \[strong\]** [[Frightened|frightened]] (save ends).

## Perks As Titles

The Director can turn a perk into a 1st echelon title by simply giving it a prerequisite. For example, a hero might gain the [[Familiar]] perk as a title instead if they complete a quest for an archmage, who then teaches the ritual to conjure the [[Familiar|familiar]] as a reward for the hero.
