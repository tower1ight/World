# Dwarf Legionnaire

*"I have learned much. It may be your courage that inspires others. Watch your opponent's shield as well* *as their sword. And above all, stand fast, and do not yield."*

**Prerequisites:** You fight alongside at least three [[Dwarf|dwarves]].

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **Close Formation:** Your stability increases by 2 while adjacent to at least two allies.
- **Rune of Alarm:** You can spend 10 minutes to inscribe a magical eye-shaped rune on a surface. The rune sheds light for 2 squares. It is dispelled if it is activated or if you inscribe the rune elsewhere. The rune is activated when an enemy comes within 2 squares of the rune. When the rune is activated, you wake up if you are nonmagically asleep, and for 1 minute you can see through the rune as if you were in its square.
- **Stonemeld:** While adjacent to a stone wall, you can use a maneuver to gain concealment. The concealment lasts until you leave the square or use an ability.
