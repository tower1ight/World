# Faction Member

*"In six months, I'll be running this place."* **Prerequisites:** You join an army, guild, or similar organization.

You gain membership in a faction. You're regarded as a promising but untested [[Agent|agent]], and you're allowed to operate independently. You can be assigned tasks to further your faction's goals, and you can expect rewards and promotion if you succeed.

When you're negotiating with a member of your faction, their starting Patience increases by 2, up to a maximum of 5.

Additionally, the Director assigns you one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the faction in question. The Director can also create a custom benefit for a faction not listed here. You can only use this benefit in a settlement where your faction can be found, and once you have used this benefit, you can't use it again until you have completed a task for your faction.

- **Academic Faction:** You can find a [[Sage|sage]] who can make up to three Reason tests to recall lore or project rolls for research projects on your behalf. The [[Sage|sage]] has a +5 bonus to these tests. Research project rolls take 10 minutes each and don't need to be made during a respite.

- **Guild Faction:** You can find an expert craftsperson who can make up to three project rolls for crafting projects on your behalf. The craftsperson has a +5 bonus to these tests. These project rolls take 10 minutes each and don't need to be made during a respite.

- **Martial Faction:** You can recruit up to three minions with levels no greater than your own, of a type appropriate for the faction (such as **[[Human|human]] guards**). These minions follow your orders for 1 day.

- **Spy Faction:** You can find an [[Agent|agent]] who can provide you with three pieces of information about a settlement you're in, such as the location of a hidden person, a secret entrance into a guarded area, or the negotiation ideal or pitfall of an important person.

You can gain this title multiple times, once for each faction. A faction can strip you of this title if you act against its interests.
