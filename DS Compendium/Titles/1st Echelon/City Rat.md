# City Rat

*"Stay out all night, visit the dives. Get in a fight, run from the cops. That's the real city."* **Prerequisites:** You have spent at least 5 respites in a metropolis.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Discerning Shopper:** When looking for an item prerequisite for a crafting project, you can remember meeting someone who might have the item--or at least information about it.
- **One with the Crowd:** You gain an edge on tests made to [[Hide|hide]] and sneak, provided you are using one or more creatures as cover.
- **Street Smart:** While in a settlement, you never suffer penalties from being surprised.
