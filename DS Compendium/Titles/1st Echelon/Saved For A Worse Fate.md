# Saved For A Worse Fate

*"Drink this. You'll need all your strength for what lies ahead!"*

**Prerequisites:** The entire party is killed or captured by intelligent foes.

After being defeated, the party awakes, alive and with their Stamina and Recoveries returned to their maximum. You are captives of the creatures that defeated you, and you await a gruesome end--unless you can escape or overcome the fiendish challenge your captors have planned.

The Director chooses one of the following benefits, based on the fate your captors have in mind for you. Each hero gains the same benefit. In addition to this benefit, you must face an encounter, montage test, or adventure of the Director's invention.

- **[[Gladiator|Gladiators]]:** You must fight to the death for your captors' amusement. Your intended opponents wield or guard a trinket or leveled item, which you can earn if you are victorious.

- **Prey:** Your captors plan to release you and hunt you down, but it's no fun unless you offer a challenge. Each of you is given medicine which raises your Speed and your number of Recoveries by 2. This benefit lasts until your next Respite.

- **Sacrifices:** You are to be dropped in a volcano, fed to a sacred monster, abandoned in a desert, or otherwise sacrificed to a higher power. You are bedecked with holy jewelry. Each hero gains 1 Wealth.

- **Saviors:** Your captors fear an even stronger foe. They want you to defeat this enemy for them. You can keep any treasure you find while doing so.
