# Doomed

*"I don't know what it meant, but when I watched her die, I saw a vision. I watched her die, and saw my own death. Am I going mad?"*

**Prerequisites:** You are not a [[Hakaan]] but have witnessed the death of a [[Hakaan]].

You're not destined for a meaningful death, but you still might achieve one. When you're reduced to 0 Stamina but still conscious, you can choose to become doomed. If you do, you can't regain Stamina, you automatically get tier 3 results on tests and power rolls, and you don't die until your Stamina equals the negative of your maximum Stamina value. At the end of the encounter, you die.
