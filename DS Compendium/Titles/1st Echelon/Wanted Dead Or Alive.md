# Wanted Dead Or Alive

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Honor Among Thieves:** You are considered to have 2 higher Renown when negotiating with [[Criminal|criminals]].
- **Minion Mower:** When you make a melee strike that targets a minion and at least one more minion is within distance of the attack, the attack gains a +3 bonus to damage.
- **No, You're Under Arrest!** You gain an edge on power rolls made to escape a [[Grab|grab]]. Additionally, when you make a successful test to escape manacles or bonds, as part of the same maneuver you can transfer the manacles or bonds to another person adjacent to you without them immediately noticing.
