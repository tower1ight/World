# Master Crafter

*"The sword Vanartha has been remade, mightier now than on the day it was forged."*

**Prerequisites:** You complete a project to imbue armor, an implement, or a weapon with a 9th-level enhancement.

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **Masterpiece:** The armor, implement, or weapon can be imbued a fourth time, with any imbuement the item qualifies for.
- **Research Dividends:** You gain the item prerequisite for an armor, implement, or weapon imbuement of your choice. You learn the project source language for that imbuement.
- **Skilled Hands:** You gain a skill from the crafting skills group used during the creation of the item. If you already have it, you instead gain an edge to tests that use the skill. In addition, you gain a second skill of your choice from the crafting skill group.
- **Strong Hands Make Light Work:** Whenever you make a project roll, you can use Might as the project roll characteristic.
