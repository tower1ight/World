# Fleet Admiral

*"All hail the [[Pirate]] Queen!"*

**Prerequisites:** [[Corsair]] title; you lead a fleet of at least three ships

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **First Mate:** You gain a [[Pirate|pirate]] retainer, such as a [[Human|human]] knave. The exact stat block of the retainer is determined by the Director and is available in the *Monsters* book for *Draw Steel*. When you gain this retainer, their level increases to your level.

- **[[Swashbuckler]]:** Your movement gains the Climb keyword.

- **Treasure Keeper:** Your wealth score increases by 1.

- **Weather Wizard:** You can alter nonmagical weather. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes and magically summon one of the following weathers, which affects a five-mile radius around you and moves with you. The weather persists for 6 hours or until you dismiss it as a free maneuver. In addition to the weather's other effects, it can affect the speed of wind-powered vessels, such as sailing ships:

- *Calm:* Wind-powered vessels and technology cease working.

- *Fog:* Visibility is reduced to 6 squares.

- *Light Winds:* There is no effect due to weather.

- *High Winds:* The speed of wind-powered vessels is doubled.

- *Storm:* The crew of an unsheltered wind-powered vessel must make a [[Medium]] group Reason test. On a failure, the vessel needs repairs and moves at half speed until it gets them.
