# Demon Slayer

*"F'lath v'korr en zaratha g'rrack."*

**Prerequisites:** You defeat a leader or solo monster with the Demon keyword, such as a Soulraker Hivequeen, or you are possessed by a demon.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Demonic Lore:** You learn the Proto-Ctholl language. Additionally, when you deal damage with a Magic ability, you can change one of the ability's damage types to holy.
- **Lethe:** While winded, you have a +5 damage bonus on all strikes.
- **Made of Teeth:** Your body can sprout teeth in unusual places. When a creature makes physical contact with you or starts their turn touching you, you can deal 5 damage to them.
- **Soulsight:** Creatures within 2 squares of you can't be hidden from you.

**Special:** When you attempt a Presence test and roll a natural 5 or lower, for 1 minute you are cursed to speak only Proto-Ctholl, whether you know that language or not.
