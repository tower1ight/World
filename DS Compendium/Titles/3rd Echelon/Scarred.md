# Scarred

*"Last time we fought, I gave you a little token to remember me by... now it appears you need another reminder of my power."*

**Prerequisite:** An enemy leader or solo monster reduces you to 0 Stamina.

You gain a visible scar (in a location of your choice).

After your next respite, you gain the following benefits, which last until the end of your next respite:

- Your Stamina increases by 20.
- The creature who scarred you takes a bane on ability power rolls against you.

**Special:** You can gain this title multiple times, no more than once per respite.
