# Maestro

*"When I saw the blood-stained manuscript under Fellwander's arm, I knew his quest for the Opera was over--and with it, his chance for redemption."* **Prerequisites:** You visit the realms of the gods, [[Devil|devils]], or other immortal beings and hear a shred of the Music of Creation.

Choose one of the following benefits.

- **Angelic Chorus:** You can use the lessons of musical improvisation in combat. Choose one triggered action from the Troubadour class. You gain that feature even if you don't meet its prerequisites. When you use this feature in this way that requires or allows you to spend Drama, you can spend a heroic resource of your class in place of Drama.
- **Music of the Spheres:** As an action, you sing or play a note as delicate and as sharp as glass, and as easily shattered. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature within 10 of you makes a strike, they take 8 sonic damage.
- **[[Devil]]'s Opera:** You gain the following ability, which can be paid for using a heroic resource of your class:
