# Enlightened

*"Don't you see? This world that seems so real to you is nothing but a game, and all the men and women merely pieces!"*

**Prerequisites:** You learn a cosmic truth that alters your understanding of reality.

You choose for your Reason or Intuition score to increase by 1, to a maximum of 6.

Choose one of the following additional benefits.

- **Cosmic Revelation:** When you make a test with a skill from the lore skill group and get a tier 1 or 2 result, you can instead get a tier 3 result. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you gain a Victory.
- **Mind Over Matter:** When you spend a Recovery, you can end one condition on yourself.
- **Rearrange the Game Pieces:** You can reach behind the curtain and alter reality. When combat begins, choose yourself or any creature within 5 squares of you. That creature must move up to their speed to space you choose without entering [[Damaging Terrain|damaging terrain]] or terrain that could give them a condition. The creature doesn't move or [[Teleport|teleport]] to that space; they are simply there. No one but you has any memory of their previous position.
