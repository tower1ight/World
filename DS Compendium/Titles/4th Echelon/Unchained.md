# Unchained

*"'Never get away withit ? ' I already have."*

**Prerequisite:** You have the [[Heist Hero]] title, and you have stolen a precious object or escaped from captivity while evading guards of at least level 8 .

Your choice of your Might or Agility score increases by 1, to a maximum of 6.

Choose one of the following additional benefits.

- **Bye-Bye:** You can use a maneuver to [[Teleport|teleport]] yourself and willing allies within 5 to new positions within 10. You can't use this benefit again until you earn a Victory.
- **Laughs at Locks:** When making a test to open a lock or break a restraint, you don't need any tools and you automatically get a tier 3 result.
- **Slippery:** You can't be [[Grabbed|grabbed]] against your will.
