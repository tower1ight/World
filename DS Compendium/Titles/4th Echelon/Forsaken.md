# Forsaken

*"The quest is done, the enemy is defeated, and the Blade of a Thousand Years has passed from our hands. What do we do with the rest of our lives?"* **Prerequisites:** The party loses, destroys, or otherwise parts with an artifact.

A characteristic of your choice increases by 1, to a maximum of 6.

Choose one of the following additional benefits.

- **Brief Reunion:** While you are winded, you can use a maneuver to summon the artifact to your hand. It disappears at the end of your next turn. Once you have used this ability, you can't do so again until you earn a Victory.
- **Perfect Protection:** The Director chooses a damage type that is dealt by or thematically related to the artifact (for instance, holy for the Sword of a Thousand Years, psychic for the Encepter, or corruption for the Mortal Coil). You gain immunity all to that damage type.
- **Poor Compensation:** Instead of disappearing or otherwise departing, the item turns into a trinket or leveled item of the Director's choice of the same approximate shape as the lost item (for instance, any magic sword for the Sword of a Thousand Years, any implement for the Encepter, or Thief of Joy or other torc for the Mortal Coil).
