# Improvisation Creation

Even without tools, you can quickly jury-rig a [[Mundane|mundane]] item or repair a [[Mundane|mundane]] piece of equipment related to a skill you have from the crafting skill group without needing to make a test. That items works for 1 hour or 1 use (whichever comes first) then breaks beyond repair. For example, if you have the carpentry skill, you can repair a rickety wooden bridge long enough for a group of creatures to cross it or build a simple shovel made of wood that works for 1 hour.
