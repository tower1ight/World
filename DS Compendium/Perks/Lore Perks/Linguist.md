# Linguist

If you spend at least 7 days in a place where you regularly hear a language you don't know spoken, you can pick up enough of that language to hold a conversation, though you still can't read it. After doing so, you can learn it twice as fast as normal. Additionally, you learn two extra languages you've heard before when you gain this perk.
