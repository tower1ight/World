# Specialist

You are a leading expert on a particular subject. Choose one skill you have from the lore skill group. You always have a double edge on tests made to recall lore that use this skill. Additionally, you have at least one major contribution to this field, such as a thesis, field guide, gazetteer, or even an ongoing newsletter you maintain. This contribution grants you notoriety in your field. You treat your Renown as 1 higher when negotiating with people who know of your work, or 2 higher if they have the skill that you chose for this perk.
