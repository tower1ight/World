# I've Read About This Place

When you enter a settlement you've never been to before, you can ask the Director one of the following questions:

- Who's the most influential public figure in this settlement?
- Who in this town would be friendly to us right now?
- What does this settlement need most from outsiders?

If the Director does not have an answer to the question you ask, you can instead ask a different question.
