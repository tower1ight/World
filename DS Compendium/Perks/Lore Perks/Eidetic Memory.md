# Eidetic Memory

Your mind is an encyclopedia, though not always an easy one to organize. After finishing a respite, choose one skill from the lore skill you don't have. You gain that skill until you finish a respite. Additionally, if you spend at least 1 minute reading a page of text, you can memorize its contents. You can memorize entire books this way.
