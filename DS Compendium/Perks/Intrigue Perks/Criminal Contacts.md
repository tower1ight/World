# Criminal Contacts

You have access to a network of [[Criminal|criminal]] contacts. As a respite activity during a respite in a settlement, you can ask a question of your contacts. Make a Presence test. On a tier 2 result, you gain knowledge that would be common among [[Criminal|criminals]] (e.g. the secret entrances into a building, the location of a local, hidden [[Criminal|criminal]], the name of a local thieves' guild leader). On a tier 3 result, you can also gain knowledge that would be uncommon among [[Criminal|criminals]], if such information exists (e.g. the location of a local treasure stock, the location of a murder weapon used in a [[Noble|noble]]'s assassination, the name of an NPC secretly bankrolling a local assassin's guild).
