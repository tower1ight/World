# Danger Sense

When in a natural environment that isn't in a settlement, you have an edge on all tests made with the Alertness skill, and you cannot be surprised. Additionally, you're attuned to the instincts of wildlife and know if a natural disaster is imminent within the next 72 hours. You don't know exactly what it will entail.
