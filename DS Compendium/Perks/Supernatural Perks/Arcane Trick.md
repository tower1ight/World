**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You [[Teleport|teleport]] an unattended size 1T or 1S object within 1 square of you to an unoccupied space within 1 square of you.
- Until the start of your next turn, a part of your body shoots a shower of harmless noisy sparks that give off light within 1 square of you.
- You ignite or snuff out (your choice) every [[Mundane|mundane]] light source within 1 square of you.
- You make up to 1 pound of edible food you can touch taste delicious or disgusting.
- Until the start of your next turn, you make your body exude a particular odor you've smelled before. This smell can be sensed by creatures within 5 squares of you, but can't impose any condition or other drawback on creatures.
- You place a small magical inscription on the surface of a [[Mundane|mundane]] object you can touch, or remove an inscription that was made by you or by another creature using Arcane Trick.
- You cover a size 1T object that you touch with an illusion that makes it look like another object. A creature who handles the object can see through the illusion. The illusion ends when you stop touching the object.
