# Invisible Force

*You manipulate a tiny object with your mind.*

| **Keywords:** Psionic   | **Type:** Maneuver                      |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 1 size 1T unattended object |

**Effect:** You can [[Grab|grab]] or manipulate the target with your mind. You can move the object up to a number of squares equal to your Reason, Intuition, or Presence score (your choice). You can use this ability to turn doorknobs, pull levers, and manipulate other smaller, movable pieces of a larger object as long as the piece you're manipulating is unattended and size 1T (though you can't use this ability to break smaller piece off of a larger object).
