# Ritualist

You can spend 1 minute performing a magic ritual of blessing. At the end of the ritual, touch one willing creature, including yourself. The creature gains a double edge on the next test they make within the next minute. A creature can't use this benefit on an activity that takes longer than a minute.

Beyond your abilities and features, you r hero might have something else that makes them ... unusual. Perhaps an earth elemental lives in your body. Maybe your eldritch blade devastates enemies but feeds on your own vitality.

A [[Complications|complication]] is an optional feature you can take to enrich your hero's backstory, with any [[Complications|complication]] providing you both a positive benefit and a negative drawback. Because [[Complications|complications]] are optional, check with your Director before taking one.
