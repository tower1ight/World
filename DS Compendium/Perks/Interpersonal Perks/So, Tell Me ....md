# So, Tell Me ...

When you succeed on a Presence test to influence another creature, you can ask one creature you influenced a follow-up question after the test resolves, which they must answer honestly. At the Director's discretion, the creature doesn't have to answer the question completely or at all if the response would put them or a loved one in danger.
