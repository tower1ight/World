# Open Book

When you have a chance to speak one-on-one with someone, you can ask them one question about themself. If they choose to answer honestly, they can immediately ask you a question about yourself in turn, which you must answer honestly. If they choose not to answer honestly, they simply deflect or redirect the question, no further [[Complications|complications]] result from the prying.
