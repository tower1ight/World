# Cursed Weapon

When you were young, you were given, or you found, a magic weapon. Since then, it's stayed by your side, possibly even inspiring you to lead the life of a hero--but the weapon is cursed.

**Benefit:** You gain a leveled weapon of your choice.

**Drawback:** You have damage weakness 2.
