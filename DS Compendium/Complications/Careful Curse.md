# Careful Curse

When you were young, you did something reckless and unthinking that endangered a hag or cost them something dear. The hag cursed you, causing you to take your time and be always cautious and thorough, even to your own detriment. If you can't shake this curse, it could be your downfall or the very thing that saves you.

**Benefit:** Until you've taken your turn in a round, strikes against you take a bane.

**Drawback:** Your speed is reduced by 1.
