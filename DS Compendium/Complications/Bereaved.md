# Bereaved

The most important person to you--perhaps a family member, mentor, or lover--was killed. The only thing that keeps you going is the faint connection you have with this person's spirit, and the hope that one day you can tie up their unfinished business and let them rest.

**Benefit:** When you don't know what to do, you can appeal to your loved one's spirit for help. You spend a hero token to let the Director determine your next combat or out-ofcombat action. The Director chooses the best course of action they can think of for you, even if it relies on information you don't have. If the Director can't think of a particularly good course of action for you to take, you don't expend the hero token.

**Drawback:** You gain corruption weakness 5.
