# Antihero

You used to be a villain. You're (mostly) reformed now, but in desperate moments, you sometimes draw on the rage and hatred that fueled your old life. In these moments, even your friends aren't sure whose side you're on. They don't need to worry, though. Once you leave evil behind, you can't go back. You've made too many enemies on the other side.

**Benefit:** You have three Antihero Tokens. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs a heroic resource, you can spend an Antihero Token to in place of one heroic resource. While you have fewer than three antihero tokens and you would earn a hero token for the group through your deeds, you instead regain one antihero token.

**Drawback:** While you have fewer than three antihero tokens, you exude a villainous aspect. You and each ally within 5 squares of you takes a bane on all tests made to interact with other creatures.
