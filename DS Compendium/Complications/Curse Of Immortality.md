# Curse Of Immortality

As long as you can remember, you've never gotten older you've just adventured through one age after another. Still, your memory of past events, even those you were involved with, is a little hazy--apparently your memory is not as long-lived as you are.

**Benefit:** You don't age. Also, when your Stamina equals the negative of your winded value, you enter a state of suspended animation indistinguishable from death. If your body is not destroyed while in this state, after 12 hours you regain consciousness and regain Stamina equal to your recovery value.

**Drawback:** You have a bane on tests made to recall lore.
