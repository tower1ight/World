# Secret Identity

You're secretly very important--but it's not safe for your true identity to be known. Perhaps you're the witness to a crime or a royal on the run from a usurper. Until the appropriate villains are punished, you'll maintain the guise of an ordinary adventurer.

**Benefit:** You gain a skill of your choice from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can resume your true identity, either temporarily or permanently. While in your true identity, your Renown and Wealth are treated as 2 higher, along with any other benefits you may gain from your identity.

**Drawback:** You have powerful and clever enemies. Until they're defeated, if you resume your true identity, there is a cumulative 20% chance that they find you and confront you each day. This chance resets if you resume your secret identity for a full day. Even if you try to keep your identity hidden, their suspicions may be raised by a careless slip.
