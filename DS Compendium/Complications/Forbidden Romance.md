# Forbidden Romance

You are in love with someone, but tragic circumstances keep you apart--perhaps your lover is from a feuding family, [[Betrothed|betrothed]] to another, or has some other animosity toward you.

**Benefit:** You can secretly call on your [[Betrothed|betrothed]] for favors. They may be powerful, but they're constrained--they can't openly reveal their connection with you.

**Drawback:** When in trouble, your lover may call on you for help--and if your relationship is discovered, your lover's family become dangerous enemies.
