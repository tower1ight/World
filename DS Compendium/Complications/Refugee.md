# Refugee

A hostile army--perhaps the forces of Ajax, the Iron Saint--conquered your homeland. Your family escaped, but you can't return home until your oppressors are defeated once and for all.

**Benefit:** When your family fled your homeland, they left their greatest treasure behind. Work with the Director to determine its nature. It might be a trinket or leveled item, several points of Wealth, a treasure's project source, or the like. This treasure is now in the hands of the invaders, until you win it back and use it against them.

**Drawback:** The faction that invaded your homeland is hostile to you.
