# Lucky

You've always had a lucky streak: when you leave things in the hands of fate, you tend to succeed more than you fail. But luck is fickle--when you don't trust it, it deserts you.

**Benefit:** When you spend a hero token to turn a failure into a success or to avoid a consequence, roll a d10. On a result of 6 or more, you don't expend the hero token.

**Drawback:** When you get a tier 1 result on a test and don't expend a hero token to turn it into a success, you gain a bane on the next test you make.
