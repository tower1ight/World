# Wrongly Imprisoned

You spent many years imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit. During your long hours of solitary confinement, you honed your skills and you recited the names of those who framed you. Someday you will have your revenge.

**Benefit:** You learn two skills of your choice, neither of which are from the interpersonal skill group.

**Drawback:** Your health suffered in prison. While you are winded, you develop a hacking cough, which makes it impossible for you to [[Hide|hide]] or sneak.
