# Gnoll-bit

As a child you survived a gnoll attack--but they left you with a toothy scar and the occasional fit of bloodlust.

**Benefit:** Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you is reduced to 0 Stamina, as a triggered action you can move up to your speed and make a [[Free Strike|free strike]].

**Drawback:** If you start your turn next to at least one creature while [[Dazed|dazed]], you must use your action to make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against an adjacent creature.

**Special:** You can't take this [[Complications|complication]] if you can't be [[Dazed|dazed]].
