# Dragon Dreams

You sometimes have strange dreams of infernos of flame ... gleaming piles of treasure ... spreading your wings and taking flight. You haven't told anyone about the dreams, except for your one strange relative who seems to know more than they're letting on.

**Benefit:** Choose two ancestry points worth of [[Dragon Knight|dragon knight]] traits. Whenever you have at least 5 Victories, you gain those traits.

**Drawback:** When you are reduced to 0 Stamina, you explode with heat and fire. You and each creature within 5 squares of you takes fire damage equal to twice your level. You can't reduce this damage for yourself in any way.
