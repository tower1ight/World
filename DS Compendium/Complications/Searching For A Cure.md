# Searching For A Cure

Your homeland has been corrupted by some terrible monster, and you're the only one who escaped the plague. The rest of your family still exists, but in changed forms perhaps as vampires or [[Zombie|zombies]]. People tell you the situation is hopeless, but you're determined to find a cure.

**Benefit:** Choose a type of monster, such as medusa or vampire. You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws and to characteristic scores for the purpose of resisting potencies against this monster's abilities.

**Drawback:** You have started to turn into one of these creatures yourself. If you don't find a cure soon ... you'll fall victim to the disease or curse. Work with your Director to determine the timeline of your disease taking effect. It should be something that could happen during the campaign!
