# Prisoner Of The Synlirii

You were captured by the psionic beings known as voiceless talkers. You escaped them, but you can't escape that feeling in the back of your mind--the feeling of being watched.

**Benefit:** You can telepathically communicate with creatures within 10 of you if they share a language with you and you know of each other. The receiver of your telepathic communications can choose to respond telepathically.

**Drawback:** Voiceless talkers within 1 mile know your location and can overhear and understand your telepathic conversations.
