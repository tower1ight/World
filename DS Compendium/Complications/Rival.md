# Rival

Whatever your accomplishments, you'll forever measure yourself against a former companion who always seemed to be one step ahead of you.

**Benefit:** Choose one of your skills. This skill grants +3 bonus to tests instead of +2.

**Drawback:** You occasionally cross paths with your rival, who has similar statistics to yours (but gains a +4 instead of a +3 in the skill you chose).
