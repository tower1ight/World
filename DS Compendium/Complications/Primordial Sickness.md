# Primordial Sickness

You once contracted a terrible illness for which no one could find a cure. You sought out a primordial swamp said to be either incredibly poisonous or miraculously salubrious. It turned out to be both, keeping your illness at bay while corrupting your body with its unnatural energy.

**Benefit:** You have poison immunity 5 and corruption immunity 5.

**Drawback:** The number of Recoveries you have is reduced by 1.
