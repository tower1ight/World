# Hawk Rider

You travel with a [[Giant Hawk|giant hawk]] that you stole from the Hawklords. Perhaps you were once a Hawklord yourself, or perhaps you escaped their captivity. Traveling with a [[Giant Hawk|giant hawk]] comes with its share of inconveniences and dangers, but they're a small price to pay for the sky.

**Benefit:** While outside, you can spend a minute to summon your [[Giant Hawk|giant hawk]] (see [[Human|Humans]] monster entry in the *Monsters* book), which acts as your mount. You can dismiss the hawk as a free action. The hawk won't go inside, and it won't accept anyone but you as a rider. If the hawk takes damage or dies, you can restore it to full Stamina as a respite activity.

**Drawback:** People who know of your crime are afraid to interact with you, since they worry the Hawklords will come after them by association. You have a bane on tests made to influence anyone who knows of the Hawklords and who has seen you with your [[Giant Hawk|giant hawk]]. Such people might report you to the Hawklords, who can come looking for you.
