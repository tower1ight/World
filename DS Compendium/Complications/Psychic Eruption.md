# Psychic Eruption

In times of stress, you get headaches. Psionic energy builds up in your mind until you feel like your head is going to explode. If you're not careful, it actually does explode, radiating psychic waves that harm friends and enemies alike.

**Benefit:** You gain the following heroic ability:

## Psychic Blast (cost: All Your Heroic Resources)

*Psionic energy bursts from your body in an iridescent shimmer.*

| :-------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Area, Psionic | **Type:** Action          |
| **Distance:** 3 burst       | **Target:** All creatures |

**Power Roll + Highest Characteristic:**

- *11 or lower:* **1 psychic damage for each heroic resources you spend, to a maximum of your level**
- *12-16:* **1 psychic damage for each heroic resource you spend, to a maximum of your level + your highest characteristic**
- *17+:* **1 psychic damage for each heroic resource you spend**

**Special:** If you are a talent and you are strained, the ability deals an additional 5 psychic damage to you and all creatures in the area.

**Drawback:** When you gain the [[Bleeding|bleeding]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or [[Weakened|weakened]] condition, you must use Psychic Blast as a free triggered action.
