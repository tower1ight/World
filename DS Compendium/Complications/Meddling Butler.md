# Meddling Butler

You're not sure what you did to deserve it, but for some reason your family saddled you with an old and trusted but irritating--family servant. They're supremely competent, of course, but they sometimes seem to forget who's in [[Charge|charge]].

**Benefit:** You gain a retainer, in addition to followers you acquire through Renown or other means.

**Drawback:** Outside of combat, your retainer is under the Director's control. The retainer sometimes acts without orders--always with your best interests at heart, but often in embarrassing or inconvenient ways.
