# Vow Of Honesty

You were brought up to a strict standard of behavior. You cannot tell a lie.

**Benefit:** As long as you don't lie, you gain the benefit of the Censor's A Sense for Truth Order feature. If you also gain the A Sense for Truth feature in another way, you also gain a double edge on tests made to persuade a creature of a specific fact.

**Drawback:** When you lie, your honor is stained, and you gain a bane on any test you make that uses a skill from the interpersonal skill group and lose this [[Complications|complication]]'s benefit. You can lose the bane and regain this [[Complications|complication]]'s benefit only by doing penance, such as gaining the forgiveness of the creature you lied to.
