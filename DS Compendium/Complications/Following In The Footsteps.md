# Following In The Footsteps

Your personal idol was a mighty hero, and you have modeled yourself on their example. You've studied their legends, and someday you hope to learn their most famous battle technique.

**Benefit:** Choose a heroic ability for your class that requires a higher level than your current one. When you learn this ability, it costs 2 heroic resources less than usual (minimum 1).

**Drawback:** In your quest for advanced techniques, you have neglected basics. Choose a heroic ability that you already know. It costs 1 heroic resource more than usual.
