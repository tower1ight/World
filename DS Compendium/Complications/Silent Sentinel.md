# Silent Sentinel

You were trained by a group of spies who psionically infused silence into your every step and enhanced your ability to hear distant whispers. It wasn't until you got caught by an elementalist who blasted you with thunder that you learned the enhanced hearing had some nasty side effects.

**Benefit:** You gain the Eavesdrop and Sneak skills and one skill from the lore skill group of your choice. Additionally, you can silently communicate with any creature, provided you share a language and can see each other.

**Drawback:** You have sonic weakness 5. Additionally, when you take sonic damage, you are [[Dazed|dazed]] until the end of your next turn.
