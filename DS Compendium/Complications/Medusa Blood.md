# Medusa Blood

Your mother and father never saw eye to eye--you know that because your father's still alive. Your mother was a medusa. It made your childhood difficult, and now it's making your adulthood complicated as well.

**Benefit:** You gain the following ability:

## Stone Eyes

*These looks don't kill--they petrify.*

|                                     |                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Attack, magic, ranged | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10             | **Target:** 1 creature |

Power Roll + Might or Presence: - *11 or lower:* 2 damage; M \< \[weak\] **[[Slowed|slowed]] (save ends)** - *12-16:* 4 damage; M \< \[average\] **[[Slowed|slowed]] (save ends)** - *17+:* 6 damage; M \< \[strong\] **[[Slowed|slowed]] (save ends)**

**Effect:** This ability has no effect on a creature that can't see you or purposely avoids looking at your eyes. If a creature is reduced to 0 Stamina by this ability, they turn to inanimate stone.

**Drawback:** Out of combat, you use Stone Eyes on anyone who meets your eye, whether you intend to or not. Your companions know not to make eye contact, but strangers are likely to trigger the ability unless you cover your eyes.
