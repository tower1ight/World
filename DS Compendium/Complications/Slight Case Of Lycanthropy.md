# Slight Case Of Lycanthropy

Maybe you were bitten as a child, or maybe it's a family curse. Either way, you have a malady that is best not discussed in public, lest the torches and pitchforks make their appearance.

**Benefit:** When you wind or kill a non-minion creature, you gain a surge.

**Drawback:** If you have five or more surges at the start of your turn, or you have at least one surge at the start of your turn while in moonlight, you lose all your surges and become a woflish hybrid until the end of your turn. While in the form, you either make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] at the nearest creature or shift up to your speed towards the nearest creature and make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against them if you can. If allies and enemies are equally close, you attack an ally.

**Special:** Stormwight furies can't take this [[Complications|complication]].
