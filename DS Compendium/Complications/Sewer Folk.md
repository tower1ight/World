# Sewer Folk

Impoverished or on the run, you spent formative years living in the sewers of a major city. There you learned lessons that have stood you well, although the miasma of the sewers did permanent damage to your health.

**Benefit:** Your movement gains either the [[Climb Or Swim|Climb or Swim]] keyword (your choice). Additionally, while in a city you and your companions can move from place to place without being detected, and you never get lost while underground.

**Drawback:** You have poison weakness 5.
