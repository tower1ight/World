# War Dog Collar

You wear a loyalty collar from one Ajax's War Dogs. You've managed to rig the collar so it explodes outward while keeping you safe.

**Benefit:** While you wear your loyalty collar, other war dogs can't use Posthumous Promotion on you. You gain the following ability.

## Posthumous Retirement

*You make your modified collar explode.*

**Keywords** Magic **Type** Maneuver **Distance** 1 burst **Target** All enemies

**Effect** Your loyalty collar detonates, dealing fire damage equal to 5 plus your level to each target. Once you have used this ability, you can't use it again until you spend 1 minute out of combat resetting the collar.

**Drawback:** When you use your Posthumous Retirement ability, the Director can spend 3 Malice to make your collar malfunction and deal damage to you.
