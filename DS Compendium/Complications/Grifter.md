# Grifter

You used to be a con artist. Those days are pretty much behind you. Being a hero is an even better racket. After all, if you're saving the world, who can be mad at you for stealing a couple of coins along the way?

**Benefit:** You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.

**Drawback:** When you meet an NPC for the first time, the Director can award the party a Hero Token. If they do so, the NPC was a victim of one of your previous cons and remembers you.
