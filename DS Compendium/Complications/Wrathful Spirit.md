# Wrathful Spirit

You're quick to anger, and some even say you're possessed by a literal spirit of wrath. You never let an insult go without slinging one right back. In combat, things are similar: no matter the tactical circumstances, when someone injures you, you feel compelled to answer blood with blood.

**Benefit:** While you are [[Taunted|taunted]] by a creature, you gain an edge on attacks against that creature. If you have the Rage heroic resource, you can spend 1 rage to make it a double edge.

**Drawback:** In conversation or negotiation, when a creature insults you, you must either spend a Recovery or reply with an insult. Furthermore, in combat, whenever a creature hits you with an strike while you are not [[Taunted|taunted]], you are [[Taunted|taunted]] (EoT) by that creature.
