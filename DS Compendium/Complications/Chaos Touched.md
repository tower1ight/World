# Chaos Touched

You came into contact with a mote of pure chaos energy or were subjected to a spell or object that fused chaos into your very being. Now you can sprout and retract limbs in a way that can horrify unprepared onlookers.

**Benefit:** You gain an edge on power rolls that are part of the [[Grab]], Escape a [[Grab]], or [[Knockback]] maneuver. Additionally, you can hold an extra item even when your hands are full.

**Drawback:** While dying, you grow and retract uncoordinated limbs, making all power rolls with a bane.
