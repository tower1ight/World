# Self Taught

While your peers were learning their trades in fancy schools, you were practicing your abilities on the mean streets with nothing but your own instinct as a guide. What you lost in polish and tactical acumen you make up for in raw power.

**Benefit and Drawback:** At the start of your turn during combat, you can forgo gaining heroic resources until the start of your next turn. If you do, until the start of your next turn your strikes deal additional damage equal to your highest characteristic score.
