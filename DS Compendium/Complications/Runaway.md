# Runaway

To your embarrassment, no sinister omens attended your birth and your closet contains no [[Skeleton|skeletons]]. You're just an ordinary person raised in a hardworking family. You're expected to carry on the family business--but who can settle down to a boring job when adventure calls! That's why you ran away.

**Benefit:** You gain a skill from the crafting skill group.

**Drawback:** Your extended family is looking for you to take you home--and you've never been able to [[Stand Up|stand up]] to them. That's why you ran away in the first place!
