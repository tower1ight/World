# Coward

Some call you a coward, just because you shriek and run when you encounter danger. Sure, you might not have the natural bravado of less-imaginative people, and sure, you're always imagining the many horrible ways you could die, but you're used to fear. When you run in terror, you run *towards* the enemy.

**Benefit:** You can move toward the source of your fear while you are [[Frightened|frightened]].

**Drawback:** When you make a saving throw to end the [[Frightened|frightened]] condition, you roll 2d10 and take the lowest result.
