# Exile

Whether you're a convicted [[Criminal|criminal]], a [[Noble|noble]] stripped of their title, or just someone who made one too many enemies, you've been cast forth from your homeland, never to return--at least, until you're strong enough to set things right.

**Benefit:** You learn an extant spoken language of your choice.

**Drawback:** If you are caught returning to your homeland, you'll be put to death.
