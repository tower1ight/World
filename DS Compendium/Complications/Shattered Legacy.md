# Shattered Legacy

You're the heir to a powerful magical treasure that has been in your family for generations. The only problem: it's broken. Some ancestor of yours broke it while saving the

world, or maybe they tripped and smashed it on a rock. It's your job to fix it.

**Benefit:** You learn a language of your choice. You gain a leveled item of your choice.

**Drawback:** The leveled item you gain from this [[Complications|complication]] is broken and completely inoperative. Repairing the item requires using the Craft Treasure project, and the goal is half what it would normally be to create such an item. You have the project source you need to fix the item, but not the item prerequisite.
