# Advanced Studies

You somehow obtained the notebook of a brilliant but eccentric member of your class. It should help you unlock powerful new abilities--if you can ever figure out what it means.

**Benefit and Drawback:** As a respite activity, you can study the notebook. Make a test using your highest characteristic. On an 11 or lower, you summon a hostile demon of your level or lower who attacks you at the end of the respite. The demon gets to act first in the combat, no matter any other creature's traits or abilities. On a 16 or less, you learn nothing and your time is wasted. On a 17+, you learn a bonus heroic ability from your class that you qualify for. You only know the ability until you finish a respite.
