# Curse Of Misfortune

You should have never pissed off that mage! Maybe they deserved your ire, or maybe you were just a bully, but whatever the case, the wizard cursed you before skipping town. Now, in moments of pressure that require great skill, you have a tendency to choke, [[Falling|falling]] and flailing in such a dramatic fashion that you take everyone with you.

**Benefit and Drawback:** When you make a test in combat and get a consequence, you and every ally within 1 falls [[Prone|prone]], causing you to barely miss any further consequence.
