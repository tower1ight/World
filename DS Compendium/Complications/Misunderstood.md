# Misunderstood

Your appearance marks you as part of a group that's universally feared. You might be a gentle soul, but you're not often given a first chance, much less a second. It's no wonder that you usually wear a hood.

**Benefit and Drawback:** When you reveal your appearance to creatures that don't know you personally, you gain an edge on tests where the Brag or Intimidate skill could be applied and a bane on tests where the Flirt, Lead, or Persuade skills could be applied.
