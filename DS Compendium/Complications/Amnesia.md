# Amnesia

You have no memory of your past before the ... incident. Hopefully you'll regain your memory soon and find out what the incident was. In the meantime, you need friends, so you're not alone when your past catches up to you.

**Benefit:** You have a supernatural possession--a 1st echelon trinket. It might have some connection with your former life.

**Drawback:** You have a bane on tests made to recall lore.
