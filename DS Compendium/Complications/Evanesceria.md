# Evanesceria

You have contracted a rare magical disease called evanesceria. There are times when you're not quite yourself--or anyone else either. You simply ... vanish. You return later with no memory of your absence.

**Benefit:** You can sometimes absent yourself from unpleasant situations. At the start of a combat round you can attempt to absent yourself by rolling a d10. On a result of 6 or higher, you disappear from reality, reappearing in the space you left, or the closest unoccupied space of your choice if it's occupied, when you take your turn. After you absent yourself, you can't attempt to absent again until you gain a Victory.

**Drawback:** When you start a respite activity, roll 2d10. If you roll a 1 on either die, you absent for the rest of the respite then reappear. You gain the benefits of taking a respite but don't perform the respite activity.
