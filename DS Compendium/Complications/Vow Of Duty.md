# Vow Of Duty

You have sworn an oath to an organization. It is your rock, and as long as your faith in it remains unshaken, you are immovable.

**Benefit:** Your stability increases by 1.

**Drawback:** If you are forced to disobey your organization's orders, your stability is reduced to 0 until your doubts are resolved or you find a new organization.
