# Betrothed

Your parents made a deal, and as part of that deal, you're supposed to marry someone--or something--you didn't choose. But no one is going to tell you what to do! They'll be sorry when you run away and become a mighty adventurer.

**Benefit:** You escaped with a dowry present: a 1st echelon trinket of your choice.

**Drawback:** People who learn of you running out on your commitment think less of you and spread nasty rumors about you. Your Renown can't ever be more than your level - 1.
