# Wodewalker

You were dying in the wode--starving and wounded, you collapsed. When you woke, you found a group of green elementalists had saved your life by infusing the regenerative bark of a tree to your body.

**Benefit:** Your recovery value increases by an amount equal to your highest characteristic score.

**Drawback:** You have fire weakness 5.
