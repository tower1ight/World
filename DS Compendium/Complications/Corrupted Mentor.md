# Corrupted Mentor

Your mentor taught you everything, and you trusted them implicitly--until they went rogue, betraying you or your organization. Their current whereabouts and activities are unknown, although there are disturbing rumors--and you, as their former pupil, are under suspicion as well.

**Benefit:** Your mentor taught you the Corrupt Spirit maneuver, which, in retrospect, should have aroused your suspicion.

## Corrupt Spirit

|                     |                    |
| :------------------ | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** Magic | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self  | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** Until the end of your turn, when you use a heroic ability against a single target, you can weaken the target's life force, dealing extra corruption damage equal to your highest characteristic score.

**Drawback:** You have holy weakness 1. Each time you Corrupt Spirit, your holy weakness increases by 1, to a maximum of your Recovery value. This weakness is reset to 1 after you take holy damage.
