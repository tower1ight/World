# Strange Inheritance

Your siblings each inherited money or land, but you got a strange, seemingly useless trinket, along with the advice that maybe you weren't cut out for an ordinary, peaceful life.

**Benefit:** You gain a somewhat inoperative 2nd echelon trinket of the Director's choice. It only works while the total of your level plus your Victories is 5 or higher. You don't learn what the item's powers are until the first time it becomes operative.

**Drawback:** With no other inheritance, you accumulated debts. The first time your Wealth exceeds 1, you lose 1 Wealth.
