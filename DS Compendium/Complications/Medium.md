# Medium

You can see [[Ghost|ghosts]] and spirits that others just don't sense. They're constantly whispering unsettling secrets in your ear--when they're not trying to kill you.

**Benefit and Drawback:** Incorporeal undead within 10 squares of you can communicate telepathically with you. Additionally, you can use the Contact Spirits ability.

## Contact Spirits

Power Roll + Intuition or Presence: - *11 or lower:* **You take corruption damage equal to 5 + your level.** - *12-16:* **A spirit speaks to you. You learn how it died, and you can ask it one question, which it can answer truthfully or untruthfully. It knows anything it knew in life, and it is aware of the events that took place in this location since its death. You can't use this ability again until you have earned 1 Victory.** - *17+:* **As 12-16, but you can ask 3 questions.**

**Effect:** If any sapient creatures have died nearby within 24 hours, you gain a double bane on the power roll if any of the creatures were hostile to you, or a double edge if they were friendly to you. You can't use this ability again until have earned at least 1 Victory.
