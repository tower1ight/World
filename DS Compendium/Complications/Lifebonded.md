# Lifebonded

In a sinister ritual, your soul has been bound to another's. When they die, you die--making you the perfect bodyguard. Who is your life bonded to: a companion? A superior officer? An enemy?

**Benefit:** Choose another creature that doesn't have the Lifebonded [[Complications|complication]]. When you die, your body disappears until that creature completes a respite or gains one Victory. You then appear next to the creature, fully healed.

**Drawback:** If the creature you're bound to dies, you die as well, no matter what other traits or features you have.
