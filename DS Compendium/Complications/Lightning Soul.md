# Lightning Soul

You were caught in a storm and stuck by lightning--but you survived. Something saved you. Maybe it was a godsgiven miracle, a latent psionic gift, or the magic of a helpful elementalist, but you absorbed the lightning into your body. It's always there, simmering under the surface.

**Benefit:** When you regain Stamina in combat, you gain a surge. Whenever you spend a surge, you can make the extra damage it deals lightning damage.

**Drawback:** When you are wet, you have damage weakness 5.
