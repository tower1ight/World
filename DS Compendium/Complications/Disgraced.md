# Disgraced

You're a disgraced member of a powerful family or guild. You've been turned out of the ancestral home, and your relatives won't give you the time of day, much less a helping hand, until you clear your name or clean up your act.

**Benefit:** You gain 1 Renown, and you learn a skill of your choice from the interpersonal or intrigue skill group.

**Drawback:** Anyone who has heard of you and is influenced by your Renown treats you as infamous. When you are part of a negotiation that ends with an NPC who has an influence of 2 or lower, that NPC makes a plan to hurt you personally and carries it out.
