# Infernal Contract ... But, Like, Bad

You made a deal with a [[Devil|devil]]--not a very good deal, but it wasn't a very good [[Devil|devil]]. Now it's too late for regrets. Your soul is forfeit unless you find a loophole or convince the [[Devil|devil]] to void the deal.

**Benefit:** Choose one of the following benefits: Your Renown increases by 2, your Wealth increases by 2, or your Stamina increases by 3.

**Drawback:** Your body bears a fiendish mark. Anyone who understands religion can tell that your soul belongs to Hell, giving you a bane on tests made to interact with them (unless they're into that). Additionally, when you die, your soul goes to Hell and you can't be restored to life.
