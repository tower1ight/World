# Promising Apprentice

You were apprenticed to a trade. Your mentor said you had a special gift, and you could have become a master of your craft--but before your training was complete, your mentor was killed.

**Benefit:** You gain a skill from the crafting skill group. Choose one of your skills from the crafting skill group. When you use this skill you gain an edge.

**Drawback:** Whoever killed your mentor cursed you. Whenever you make a test that you don't apply one of your skills to, you have a bane on the test.
