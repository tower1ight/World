# Mundane

You're hopelessly nonmagical. When you try to use magical abilities, or when they're used on you, they never work right. Even magical devices seem to fizzle in your presence.

**Benefit:** You have corruption, holy, and psychic damage immunity equal to your level.

**Drawback:** While you are carry more than three magic treasures, you have a bane on all power rolls.
