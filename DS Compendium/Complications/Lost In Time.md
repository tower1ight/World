# Lost In Time

In a long-ago age, a cataclysm overtook your city. You weren't killed, but through some arcane accident you were suspended in time--until now. Alone, you must navigate the modern world with a head full of outdated memories--and a few ancient secrets.

**Benefit:** Choose a damage type from acid, cold, corruption, fire, holy, lightning, poison, psychic, or sonic. When you use a signature ability, you can use your chosen damage type instead of the ability's normal damage.

**Drawback:** You automatically fail any test made to recall information from after you were suspended in time.
