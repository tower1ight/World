# Ivory Tower

You studied in an academy or other educational institution. Your training was thorough and your reading list was wide-ranging, but when you left school you discovered that there were serious gaps in your education. Maybe some of those books were a little out of date.

**Benefit:** You learn three skills and one dead language.

**Drawback:** The Director chooses one of the skills you learned from this [[Complications|complication]]. You lose that skill and can't ever learn it. When you make a test to which this skill would apply, instead of gaining a +2 bonus you suffer a bane.
