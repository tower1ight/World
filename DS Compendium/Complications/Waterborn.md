# Waterborn

You nearly lost your life at sea, but then you heard the voice. Someone ... something in the sea called out to you telling you to swim. Suddenly the ocean wasn't your doom. It was your parent, birthing you into something new. You emerge with a small piece of the ocean's power. For what purpose--you can't be sure.

**Benefit:** Your movement gains the Swim tag, and you can breathe underwater. Additionally, you can summon water to do your bidding. You gain the following ability.
