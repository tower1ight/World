# Consuming Interest

Ever since you were a kid, you've been obsessed with a certain topic. During your travels, you spend your free time gleaning all the information you can on it. You might not be the world's leading expert quite yet, but people should certainly trust your opinion on the topic.

**Benefit:** You gain a skill from the lore skill group. You can use the following project up to three times for that skill. Each time you use the project, you must use a different project source.

## Study Lore

**Item Prerequisite:** None

**Project Source:** A significant source of information on the topic, such as a major library or a world-renowned [[Sage|sage]]

**Project Roll Characteristic:** Reason

**Project Goal:** 120 the first time, 150 the second time, 180 the third time

Your knowledge of your chosen field increases. When you finish this project, the bonus to tests provided by your skill increases from +2 to +3, +3 to +4, or +4 to +5.

**Drawback:** You can't imagine ever being wrong on the subject. When you make a test to recall lore using your chosen skill, the Director makes the test in secret. Instead of informing you whether you're right or wrong, they provide you with correct information if you succeeded or false information if you failed.
