# Outlaw

You might be a common bandit or an idealistic freedom fighter, but in either case, the local authorities don't approve of your actions. You've managed to stay one step ahead of the law, but until your name is cleared you've got to keep a low profile.

**Benefit:** You gain 1 Renown.

**Drawback:** Law enforcement officials and bounty [[Hunter|hunters]] who recognize you attempt to arrest you.
