# War Of Assassins

Being in the wrong place at the wrong time saw you caught in the middle of a conflict between two warring thieves guilds. Whether by choice or by accident, you wound up helping one faction at the expense of the other.

**Benefit:** Having gained the favor of the faction who you helped, you can call on its members three times for favors. If a favor is reasonable and within the faction's power to grant, they'll do it, no questions asked.

**Drawback:** The faction you wronged hates you, and its members would love to see you pay for your transgression.
