# Chosen One

Maybe the stars marked you out at your birth, or maybe your name appears in an ancient prophecy. In any case, a sinister cult has decided that you're very important to their plan--though you don't particularly like the fate they have in mind for you.

**Benefit:** You have three Destiny Points. You can spend a Destiny Point in place of a heroic resource of your class. Each time you gain a Victory, you regain one Destiny Point.

**Drawback:** When you spend a Destiny Point, you take 1d10 psychic damage and the cult that seeks you becomes aware of your location.
