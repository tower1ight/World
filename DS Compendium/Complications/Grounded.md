# Grounded

As a child, when your settlement was in danger, you called out to the earth for aid. The earth answered with a shower of protecting earthen walls, and since then, you've felt its presence as a friend and protector.

**Benefit:** You gain the 1st-level Elementalist Specialization feature Manipulate Earth. If you also gain Manipulate Earth in another way, you can use the ability as a ranged ability with a distance of ranged 5.

**Drawback:** You attract lightning. When any creature within 2 squares of you takes lightning damage, you take 5 lightning damage, which ignores any lightning immunity you have.
