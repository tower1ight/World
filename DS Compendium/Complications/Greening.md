# Greening

A great tree in the middle of a forest called upon you to clear its roots of the ichor moss draining its life force. As you removed the moss, you felt as if you were being filled with green elemental energy. Sadly, the great tree withered before you could finish the job, leaving behind a golden sapling which you now carry with you.

**Benefit:** You have corruption resistance 5.

**Drawback:** You have fire weakness 5.
