# Fallen Immortal

You used to be an immortal creature, dispensing justice and doing the bidding of the gods. Now, as a punishment or perhaps as a reward, you have put aside your wings and become a mortal. Your remaining years will be short, but living aside your fellow mortals gives your life new meaning.

**Benefit:** You gain the Religion skill. Additionally, when you deal untyped damage, you can deal holy damage instead.

**Drawback:** You will never fully gain a mortal's comfort with untruth. When you make a test to deceive another creature, you do so with a bane.
