# Curse Of Poverty

A soothsayer once told you you'd never be rich, but you'd survive the impossible--but you're determined to prove 'em wrong. You'll get rich or die trying!

**Benefit and Drawback:** When you take a respite while your personal Wealth is greater than 1, some improbable event occurs that causes most of your money to vanish. Your Wealth is reduced to 1. For each Wealth that you lose, your number of Recoveries increases by 1 until you take a respite with fewer Recoveries than your maximum.
