# Hunter

You're hunting someone or something--perhaps a wanted [[Criminal|criminal]] or someone who wronged you, or perhaps a dangerous monster or beast. You won't rest until you meet your quarry face to face!

**Benefit:** Choose one skill from Alertness, [[Criminal]] Underworld, Eavesdrop, Interrogate, Rumors, Search, Track, or Society. You gain that skill, and you have an edge on tests made to find or learn clues about your quarry.

**Drawback:** You are so obsessed with finding your quarry that you have a bane on tests made to track other creatures.
