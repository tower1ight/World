# Lost Your Head

A [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]] stole your head! Normally, being beheaded by one of these giants is fatal, but due to your latent psionic ability you're able to survive despite your decapitation.

**Benefit:** You gain the following ability.

## Share Head

*You don't have a head but can psionically borrow another.*

|                               |                                  |

| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver               |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10       | **Target:** One willing creature |

You can see, hear, and smell as if you were in the creature's space. Additionally, you can borrow their mouth to speak when you wish to do so. You speak in a different voice than theirs. This effect ends when you use Share Sense on a different target, when the creature moves more than 10 away from you, or when the creature is no longer willing to share their head with you.

**Drawback:** Having no head, you can't see, hear, smell, or taste except by using the Share Head ability. Additionally, you can't wear gear that requires a head, such as helmets or hats.
