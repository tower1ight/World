# Ward

Your childhood sweetheart was royalty, and the two of you stayed close throughout the years. When your former sweetheart died, you swore an oath to dedicate your life to become a tutor for their child, advising them in the ways of being a benevolent [[Monarch|monarch]].

**Benefit:** You know how to talk to monarchs, [[Aristocrat|aristocrats]], and other wealthy leaders. When you engage with any such NPC during a negotiation, their patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5).

**Drawback:** Your royal ward can be a burden. When you start a respite, roll a d10. On a roll of 1, your ward contacts you and requires your help during the respite, requiring you to spend your time helping them instead of taking a respite activity.
