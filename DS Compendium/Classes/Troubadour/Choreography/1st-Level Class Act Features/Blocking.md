# Blocking

*No, no, no, you lose the audience that way. Try it like this ...*

|                                    |                     |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Area, Magic, Routine | **Type:** No action |
| **Distance:** 2 aura               | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** At the end of each of your turns while this routine is active, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your Presence score in the aura, causing those creatures to be teleported to unoccupied squares in the aura. A target can't be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.
