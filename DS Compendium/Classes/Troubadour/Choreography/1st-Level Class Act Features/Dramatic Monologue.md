# Dramatic Monologue

*It doesn't need to make sense. Just say it with emotionality.*

|                             |                     |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10     | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You orate a rousing tale of victory. One ally within distance gains an edge on the next power roll they make before the start of your next turn.
- You weave a tale of high stakes heroics. One ally within distance gains a surge.
- You insult a foe where they're most vulnerable. That foe takes a bane on the next power roll they make before the end of their next turn.

**Spend 1 Drama:** You can choose two targets for any of these effects.
