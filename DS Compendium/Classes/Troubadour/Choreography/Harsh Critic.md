# Harsh Critic (3 Drama)

*Just one bad review will ruin their day.*

|                                            |                                    |

| **Keywords:** Magic, Melee, Ranged, Strike | **Type:** Action                   |
| **Distance:** Melee 1 or ranged 10         | **Target:** One creature or object |

Power Roll + Presence: - *11 or lower:* **7 + P sonic damage** - *12-16:* **10 + P sonic damage** - *17+:* **13 + P sonic damage**

**Effect:** The first time the target uses an ability before the start of your next turn, any tier-related effects of that ability other than damage are suppressed, negating those effects for all targets. Ability effects that always happen regardless of the power roll work as usual.
