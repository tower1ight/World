**Trigger:** The target uses a non-area ability that targets one enemy.

**Effect:** The target chooses an additional target for the triggering ability within distance of that ability. They use the original power roll for all additional targets. Any damage dealt to an additional target is sonic damage.

**Spend 2 Drama:** The target chooses two additional targets instead of one.
