# My Reputation Precedes Me

You can invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with a group of creatures who haven't met you before, automatically creating a bond with a representative NPC as if using your Scene Partner feature (see above). While the bond is active, all present heroes are treated as having Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations and influencing tests with the group.

The Director can choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond, making you infamous with the community instead. Until actions are taken to improve your reputations, all present heroes take a bane on tests using skills from the interpersonal skill group with the group of creatures. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the community.
