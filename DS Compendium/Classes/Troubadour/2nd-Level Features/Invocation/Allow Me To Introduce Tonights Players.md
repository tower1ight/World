# Allow Me To Introduce Tonight's Players

Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use your action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each creature on your side can shift up to their speed and gains the benefit of the Defend action (see Actions) until the end of the round. However, any enemies who were surprised are no longer surprised.
