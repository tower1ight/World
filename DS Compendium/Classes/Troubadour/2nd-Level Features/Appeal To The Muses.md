# Appeal To The Muses

You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows' spirits to heighten the drama of your present circumstances. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain and achieve the same ends.

Whenever you roll to gain 1d3 drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal to gain the following additional effects:

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director also gains 1d3 Malice.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep for yourself or give to an ally within the distance of your active routine. The Director also gains 1 Malice.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 Heroic Resources, which you can distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your active routine.
