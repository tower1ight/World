| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** Self and 1 willing ally |

**Effect:** Each target shifts up to 5 squares, and can shift vertically. Both targets must end this movement adjacent to each other and on solid ground. Each target can then make a melee free strike that deals additional damage equal to twice their highest characteristic score.
