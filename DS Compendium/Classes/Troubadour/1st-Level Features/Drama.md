# Drama

During battles, you are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and upside downs of the fray, from which you derive a Heroic Resource called drama.

## Drama In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during battle:

- **2 Drama:** Three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn for the first time.
- **2 Drama:** A hero becomes winded for the first time (only once per encounter and not once per hero).
- **3 Drama:** A creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20.
- **10 Drama:** A hero, including you, dies.

You still gain drama during combat if you are dead as long as your body is intact. During the encounter in which you died, if you have 30 drama, you can come back to life with

1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action required). You can't gain drama in future encounters while you remain dead.

You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

## Drama Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama on it equal to your Victories.
