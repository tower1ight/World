# Curtain Call

You enter every performance with a set of routines at the ready. Routines are auras and other wide-reaching effects that have the Routine keyword, and which center around you while you move through the fray. At the start of each round of combat, as long as you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either set a new routine to be active or maintain your current routine (no action required). Your routine ends if you are unable to maintain it, or at the end of the encounter.

You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick routine ability. Your choice of troubadour class act then grants you additional routines.
