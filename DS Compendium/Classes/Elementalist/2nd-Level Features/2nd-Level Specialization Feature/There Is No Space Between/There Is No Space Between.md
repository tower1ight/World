# There Is No Space Between

*Knowledge of the mystery reveals two spaces are the same space.*

| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10           | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces in range, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice within 1 square of the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal you emerge from when you enter a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.
