# Disciple Of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level in this class. Any fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you deal damage with a surge, you can make that damage fire damage.
