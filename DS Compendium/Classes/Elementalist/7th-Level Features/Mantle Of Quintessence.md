# Mantle Of Quintessence

You don't need essence to keep your Mantle of Essence active. Outside of combat, you can choose whether to activate or deactivate your specialization's effects on the aura.

Additionally, your Mantle of Essence now gives off a dwoemer that fills the area and calms any tense air. Creatures in your aura have their starting patience increased by 1 during negotiations. You and allies have an edge on tests made to handle animals within your aura. If you have 5 or more Victories, the bonus to patience increases to 2 and tests to handle animals have a double edge.
