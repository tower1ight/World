# Hide Of Tenfold Shields

Your animal forms become hardier. You gain temporary Stamina equal to your level in this class when you enter an animal form in combat. This temporary Stamina is added to any provided by the animal form.

Additionally, whenever an adjacent ally uses a maneuver to pet you, you can decrease your temporary Stamina down to a minimum of 0. The ally gains temporary Stamina an equivalent amount you lost.
