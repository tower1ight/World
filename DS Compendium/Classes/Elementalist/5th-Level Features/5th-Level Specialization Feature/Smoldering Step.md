# Smoldering Step

You can use 1 square of movement to walk into a body of fire your size or larger and teleport to any other body of fire your size or larger within 10 of the first body of fire.

Additionally, whenever you use a fire ability or are targeted by an ability that deals fire damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire damage equal to your Reason score.
