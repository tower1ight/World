# The Mountain Does Not Move

You stand firm and magnetize your allies to stay grounded. Your stability increases by your level in this class.

Additionally, whenever an ally within range of your Hurl Element ability is force moved, you can use a free triggered action to decrease your stability down to a minimum of 0 to increase their stability an equivalent amount until the end of the round.
