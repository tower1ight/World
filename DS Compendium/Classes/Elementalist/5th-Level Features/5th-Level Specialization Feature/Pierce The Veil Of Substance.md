# Pierce The Veil Of Substance

Solidity is merely a suggestion to you. Mundane barriers that are less than 1 square thick or less do not block your sight or line of effect. You can only see or have line of effect past one such barrier at a time.

Additionally, whenever you use a void ability, you or an ally within distance of the ability can teleport a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
