# Return To Oblivion (11 Essence)

*You create a tear in reality that could consume everything that slips inside of it.*

| **Keywords:** Area, Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                 | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** You create a size 1L vortex that lasts until the end of the encounter. At the start of each round, all enemies within 5 of the affected area while it is unoccupied are vertical pulled 3 towards it. An enemy who enters the vortex or starts their turn there is knocked prone. A nonleader, non-solo enemy who is winded in the vortex at the end of the round is instantly destroyed.
