**Effect:** A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within range. The tree has 100 Stamina and can't be force moved. When you or an ally start your turn with line of effect to the tree, that creature can end one condition or effect that has a duration of EoT or can be ended by a saving throw that is effect affecting them or stand up from prone. You and all allies can touch the tree to use Catch Breath as a free maneuver. An enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree are restrained until the end of their next turn and can use their action to end the effect early.
