# The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If it is a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return to Formlessness ability instead.

Additionally, enemies who start their turn adjacent to you have fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or wearing mostly metal.
