# Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull some of the sturdiest titans towards your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target 1 creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull the target up to 5 squares. Even if their stability would reduce this forced movement to 0, they are still pulled at least 2 squares. You can ignore the stability of willing allies with this forced movement.

Your Mantle of Essence also improves. All enemies and objects have their stability reduced by your level while they are within the aura.
