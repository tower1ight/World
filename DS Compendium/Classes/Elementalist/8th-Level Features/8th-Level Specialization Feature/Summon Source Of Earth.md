# Summon Source Of Earth

*The ground rumbles as they burst forth, ready to serve.*

| **Keywords:** Earth, Magic, Persistent | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance. The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their speed and either taking an action or a maneuver but not both. The source is dismissed at the start of your next turn.

The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you cannot use this ability again until you earn at least 1 Victory.

**Persistent 2:** The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of your next turn.

**Earthwalk**

Difficult terrain composed of earth and stone doesn't cost the source extra movement.

**Tunneler**

When the source burrows, they create a size-2 tunnel.

**Earth Harness**

A creature that has the The Earth Accepts Me ability can use it as a free action to meld into the source.
