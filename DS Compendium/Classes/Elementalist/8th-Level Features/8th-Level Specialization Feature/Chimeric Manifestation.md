# Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can either enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use the Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. If both animal forms give you the same benefit you select the one with the larger value to apply. When determining speed, choose the highest speed benefit and all movement tags from both animal forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or lower. For example, you can combine a shark (Level 8) with a horse (Level 4), but you cannot combine a shark with a bear (Level 5).
