# Erase (7 Essence)

*With a flick of the wrist, you phase creatures out of existence.*

|                                           |                     |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged, Strike, Void | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                   | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** The number of creatures you target with this ability is determined by your power roll.

Power Roll + Reason: - *11 or lower:* **One creature** - *12-16:* **Two creatures** - *17+:* **Three creatures**

Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). While fading from existence, a target initially takes a bane on power rolls. At the end of their first turn, they have a double bane on power rolls. At the end of their second turn, they fade from existence for 1 hour, reappearing in their original space or the nearest available space.
