# One

You become the embodiment of your chosen specialization element. When you are using magic, elemental motes of your chosen element flit around you and your skin changes its appearance to reflect the element, taking on an earthen or stoney appearance for earth, appearing like flickering flame for fire, gaining a leaf pattern for green, and becoming a starry expanse for void). In addition, you gain the following benefits based on your specialization.

[MASTER OF GREEN](./Master%20Of%20Green.md)
