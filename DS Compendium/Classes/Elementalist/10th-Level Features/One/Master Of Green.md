# Master Of Green

The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2. When you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished a respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies' extra Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.

As a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause the tree to produce another 1d6 fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.

A creature can consume a Life Fruit as a maneuver or feed it to an adjacent, willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, all their Stamina is restored and can end any conditions or effects that are affecting them that they want, including using the Stand Up maneuver to end the prone condition. In addition, if the creature desires, their aging process pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats a second Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging process, the effects don't stack. The pause with the most time remaining is the one that takes effect.
