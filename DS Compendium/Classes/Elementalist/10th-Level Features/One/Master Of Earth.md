# Master Of Earth

You have damage immunity 5.

As a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can cause sinkholes to open, mountains to form, create canyons, cause islands to rise or sink into the sea, and the like. You can't use this activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.
