# Wyrding

You can spend 10 minutes to create a freeform magical wyrd for a variety of situations. Choose one of the following magical effects:

- You create a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason or smaller.
- You construct a place of shelter that lasts for 24 hours that cannot be detected by enemies.
- You restore all Stamina to a mundane object of a size equal to your Reason or smaller.
- You fill or clear an area within 5 with difficult terrain or natural phenomena (such as fire, water, or plantlife) in a cube equal to your Reason or smaller.
- You preserve a corpse or up to 5 pounds of food for a week or cause it to instantly rot.
- You create a seal on a surface that can't be seen or felt by anyone but you. When a creature comes within 10 squares of the surface, you can see and hear through the seal for as long as the creature remains within 1 square of the seal. When you create the seal, you can decide to limit the number of creatures who activate it by choosing a creature keyword (such as Undead) or a specific name (such as Ajax the Invincible) or organization (such as the Black Iron Pact). The seal only alerts you when creatures with the keyword, name, or organizational affiliation you provide pass by it. If you create a second seal, the first one disappears. You can dispel a seal as no action.
