# Magma Titan (9 Essence)

*Their body swells with lava, mud, and might, towering over their enemies.*

|                                                 |                            |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Earth, Fire, Green, Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver         |
| **Distance:** Self or Ranged 10                 | **Target:** Self or 1 ally |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target gains the following effects:

- Their size and stability increase by 2 (any size 1 targets become size 3). You slide each creature that is within the target's new space to the nearest unoccupied space (ignoring stability). If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until the effect ends.
- The target gains fire immunity 10.
- The target's strikes deal additional fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.
- When they force move a creature or object, they can increase the distance by 2.
- They can use their highest characteristic in place of Might for Might power rolls.

**Persistent 2:** The target can spend 2 Recoveries at the start of your turn. The effects persist until the start of your next turn.
