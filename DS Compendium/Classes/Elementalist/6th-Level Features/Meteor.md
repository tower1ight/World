# Meteor (9 Essence)

*You teleport the target into the air and let the ground do the rest.*

|                                                      |                                  |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Area, Earth, Fire, Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                              | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

Power Roll + Reason: - *11 or lower*\*\*: teleport 4 squares\*\* - *12-16:* **teleport 6 squares** - *17+:* **teleport 8 squares**

**Effect:** If the target falls and takes damage as if their Agility score were 0 immediately after being teleported, the damage they take from falling is fire damage, and each enemy within 3 of where the target lands takes the same damage. The ground within 3 of where the target lands becomes difficult terrain.
