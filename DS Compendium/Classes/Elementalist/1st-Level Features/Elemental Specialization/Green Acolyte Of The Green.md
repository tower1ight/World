# Green: Acolyte Of The Green

You gain this feature if green is your specialization, harnessing the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures with a green magic ability that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.
