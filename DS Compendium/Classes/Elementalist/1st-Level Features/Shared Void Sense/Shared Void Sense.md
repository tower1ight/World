# Shared Void Sense

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10           | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. That creature gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of Shared Void Sense.
