**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that takes up at least 2 squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it.

You can instead touch a doorway or other opening in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface that is no larger than 1 square. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.
