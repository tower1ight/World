**Effect:** You conjure a size 2 rolling machine that appears in an unoccupied space. When the machine first appears, make the following power roll once, targeting each enemy adjacent to it.

Power Roll + Intuition: - *11 or lower:* **3 damage** - *12-16:* **5 damage** - *17+:* **8 damage**

On each subsequent turn, you can use a free maneuver to move the machine a number of squares up to your Intuition score then repeat the power roll. The machine disappears at the end of the encounter and has 50 Stamina. It has poison all and psychic all damage immunity.
