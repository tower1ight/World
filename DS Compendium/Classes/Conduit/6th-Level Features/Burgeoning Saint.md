# Burgeoning Saint

You are infused with power your deity reserves for their most worthy instruments. You gain the following benefits:

- You have an edge on Presence tests made to interact with other creatures.
- You deal damage to an enemy, you can spend a Recovery.
- You have corruption or holy immunity 10.
- Your clothing and equipment changes in such a way that reflects your status as the deity's chosen champion, such as normal robes turning into gold vestments or a simple dagger becoming a wicked blade with intricate etching.
