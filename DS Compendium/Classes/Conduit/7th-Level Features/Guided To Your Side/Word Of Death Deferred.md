# Word Of Death Deferred

You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within your Healing Grace distance dies and you are not dying, you can use a free triggered action to instead have them fall unconscious until they regain Stamina.

Additionally, your abilities deal an additional 5 damage to winded creatures.
