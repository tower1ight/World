# Light Of The Burning Sun

Sun is infused in your body. When you deal damage to another creature with an ability, that ability deals 5 fire damage or 15 fire damage to undead creatures. In addition, you have fire immunity equal to your level. This fire immunity stacks with any other fire immunity you have.
