# Faith's Sword

When you finish a respite, you can choose a willing hero ally who took the respite with you. That hero gains the benefits of your Burgeoning Saint ability until you finish another respite. You can spend piety as a free maneuver on your turn to give the hero 1 of their heroic resource for every 2 piety spent.
