# Invocation Of The Heart

You can forge a bond of love and friendship with a willing creature you touch as an action. While this bond is active, you can telepathically speak with the creature over any distance, including interplanar. Additionally, while this bond is active, you can attempt to assist the creature with any test they make, regardless of their proximity to you. You can end this bond at any time (no action required). You can only have one of these bonds active at a time.
