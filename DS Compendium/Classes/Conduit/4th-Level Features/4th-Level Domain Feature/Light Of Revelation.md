# Light Of Revelation

As a maneuver, you can make your body shine brightly, illuminating your space and any space within 5 squares of you. This light shines through any darkness. Hidden creatures in the area automatically revealed, and creatures in the light, including you, can't hide. You have an edge on tests made to notice hidden objects and entrances and to detect supernatural illusions while the aura is active.
