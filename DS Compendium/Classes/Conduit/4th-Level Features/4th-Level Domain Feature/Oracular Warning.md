# Oracular Warning

When you finish a respite, you can share the details of the vague dreams of the future granted to you by the gods that you had while resting with any other creatures finishing the respite with you. These details help you and your allies stay alive, granting you 10 + your level Temporary Stamina that lasts until the end of your next respite if it doesn't disappear through damage first.
