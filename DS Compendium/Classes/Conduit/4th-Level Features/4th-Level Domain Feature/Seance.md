# Seance

You can commune with a network of spirits. As a respite activity, you can speak the name of a creature who died who isn't undead. If the creature's spirit is free and willing to speak with you, they appear and you can have a conversation with them. During this time, the creature responds to you as they would have in life. If the creature isn't free or willing to appear, you can use your respite activity to do something else or call out to another name.
