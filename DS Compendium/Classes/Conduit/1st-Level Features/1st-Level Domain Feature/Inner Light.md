# Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus on saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.
