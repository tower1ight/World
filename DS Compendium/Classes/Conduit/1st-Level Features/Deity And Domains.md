# Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Gods and Religion chapter, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

(*Quick Build:* Adun for deity, Life and Protection for domains)
