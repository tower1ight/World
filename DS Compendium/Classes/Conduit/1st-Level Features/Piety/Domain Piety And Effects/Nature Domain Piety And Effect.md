# Nature Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage.

**Prayer Effect:** Vines whip up from the floor or ground within 10 squares of you, wrapping around a number of creatures of your choice equal to your Intuition score. You can slide each creature up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score. The vines then fade away.
