# Fate Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an ally within 10 squares of you gets a tier 3 result or an enemy within 10 squares of you gets a tier 1 result.

**Prayer Effect:** You call on the forces of fate to create a reliable future. Choose a creature within your line of effect. That creature automatically gets a tier 1 or tier 3 result (your choice) on their next power roll made before the end of the encounter.
