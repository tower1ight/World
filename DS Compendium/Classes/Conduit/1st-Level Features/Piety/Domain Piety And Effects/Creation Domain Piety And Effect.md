# Creation Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you uses an ability with the Area keyword.

**Prayer Effect:** You summon the forces of creation and create a wall of stone whose size is 5 + your Intuition score within 10 squares of you. The wall lasts until the end of the encounter.
