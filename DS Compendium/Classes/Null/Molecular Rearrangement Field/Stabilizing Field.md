# Stabilizing Field (7 Discipline)

*You project order, making it harder for your enemies to interfere with you and your allies.*

|                       |                    |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** Psionic | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self    | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, the area of your Null Field ability increases by 1. While the area is enlarged this way, you and any ally in the area ignore difficult terrain, reduce the potency of enemy effects targeting them by 1, and can use a free triggered action at the start of each of their turns to end one condition or effect that is affecting them.
