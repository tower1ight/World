# Enhanced Null Field

When using your Null Field, you disrupt ongoing magical effects. Any magical terrain effects during combat of your level or lower are removed when your aura partially or

fully enters overlaps with their location. Permanent magical effects of your level or lower are disrupted while your aura overlaps, but return when the aura no longer overlaps.
