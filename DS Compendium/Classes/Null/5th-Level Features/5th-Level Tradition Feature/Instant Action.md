# Instant Action

If you are not surprised, you can take your first turn in combat before any other creature goes. If you are surprised, you can spend 3 discipline to no longer be surprised and still go first. You have an edge on ability power rolls on your first turn of combat if you go first.

If the heroes have more than hero with this feature, only one can benefit from the ability per encounter. Any other nulls instead can take a Disengage move action as a free triggered action before the first turn.
