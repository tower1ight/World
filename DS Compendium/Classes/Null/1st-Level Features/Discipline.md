# Discipline

As your mastery of your body and tradition grows, it imbues you with a Heroic Resource called discipline.

## Discipline In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 discipline. Additionally, you gain 1 discipline the first time in a round an enemy in your null field takes an action. You gain 1 discipline the first time in a round that an enemy

uses Malice. You lose any remaining discipline at the end of the encounter.

## Discipline Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline on it equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the null but might appear in future products.)
