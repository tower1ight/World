# Null

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body. You require no weapons, no tools. Any tool can be turned against the hand that wields it. *You* suffice.

As you strive for perfect order, you become an enemy of that ultimate expression of chaos: magic. Those who employ sorcery or psionics to break the laws of nature should fear you.

The null is an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs the effects of magic and psionics. You need no weapon because you are the weapon. Play a null if you want to resist the supernatural forces of the universe with expert calm and confidence.
