| **Keywords:** Ranged, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10              | **Target:** 1 creature |

Power Roll + Presence: - *11 or lower:* **5 + P damage; I \< \[weak\] slowed (save ends)** - *12-16:* **9 + P damage; I \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)** - *17+:* **12 + P damage; I \< \[strong\] slowed (save ends)**

**Effect:** While the target is slowed, their allies within 5 squares of them must make a free strike against the target once as a free maneuver at the beginning of their turns. In addition, while the target is slowed, any allies within 5 of the target must retarget any triggered free strikes to the target instead.
