# Timeless Insight

Your constant, fragmentary visions become clearer and can be honed to understand the past of creatures you interact with. You can make a medium Presence test to see visions from the past of any creature you are speaking with. Success gives you a clear view of any topic you wish to understand. Success with a consequence gives you two views, one false and one true. You lose 2d6 Stamina on a failure.
