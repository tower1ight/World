# Demonologist

You have been taught the more esoteric secrets of your order. To defeat your enemy you must understand them. You have additional 2 Renown with demons, devils and other agents of chaos. If you successfully negotiate with one of these creatures, you gain a permanent edge on all future power rolls against that creature and can use Judgment on them as a free triggered action before an encounter begins.
