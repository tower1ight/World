# Revelator (5 Wrath)

*You channel holy energy to harm unbelievers and reveal those hidden from your judgment.*

|                           |                                    |

| **Keywords:** Area, Magic | **Type:** Maneuver                 |
| **Distance:** 3 burst     | **Target:** Each enemy in the area |

**Effect:** Each target takes twice your Presence in holy damage. Any hidden enemies are automatically revealed and can't become hidden again until the start of your next turn. You can use Judgment on one of the targets as a free triggered action.
