# It Was Foretold

Your order has trained you to understand fragments of the constant visions given to you by your deity, giving you a momentary advantage in challenging situations. At the start of an encounter, you can take one action before any other creature and before your first turn. Additionally, whenever a montage test is called for, you can make one test before the montage begins.
