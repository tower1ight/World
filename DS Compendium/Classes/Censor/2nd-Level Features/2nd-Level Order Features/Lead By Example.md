# Lead By Example

Your devotion to your deity allows you to take command of the battlefield, letting your allies benefit from your wisdom. When you are adjacent to a target, any ally gains the benefits of flanking against that target. Additionally, each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to aid other creatures with their tests.
