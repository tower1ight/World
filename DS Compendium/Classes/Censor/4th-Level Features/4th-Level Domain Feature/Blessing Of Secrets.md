# Blessing Of Secrets

*You project an illusory aura that makes you and allies harder to notice.*

|                               |                                 |

| **Keywords:** Magic           | **Type:** Maneuver              |
| **Distance:** Self and 3 aura | **Target:** Self and all allies |

**Effect:** Each creature in the aura has a double edge on tests made to hide and sneak. The aura lasts until you end it (no action required), or a creature affected by it harms or deals damage to an object or another creature.
