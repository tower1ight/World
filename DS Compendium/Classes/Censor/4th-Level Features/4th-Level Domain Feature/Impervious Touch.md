# Impervious Touch

As a maneuver, you can touch an object with a size equal to your Presence score or smaller and place a protective spell on it. The object gains immunity to weapon damage. You can remove the spell on an object as no action, no matter your distance from it. You can only have this spell active on a number of objects equal to your Presence score.

In addition to the number of objects equal to your Presence score, you can place this spell on a building or vehicle (or similar structure with your Director's approval) that is of a size larger than your Presence score. You can only place it on one building at a time.
