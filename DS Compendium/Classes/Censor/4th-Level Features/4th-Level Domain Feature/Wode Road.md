# Wode Road

As an action you touch a living tree and make it part of a divine transportation network. Whenever you touch another living tree, you can use an action to teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 10 squares of you to a tree that is part of your network on the same world as the tree you touch. You can have a number of trees in your network equal to your Presence score. If a tree in your network dies, it is no longer part of the network. You can remove a tree from your network no matter your distance from it, including interplanar (no action required).
