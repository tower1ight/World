# Look On My Work And Despair

Your judgment has grown in divine power, manifesting your deity's ire against blasphemers, causing them to fear your actions, especially when their allies are smited. Whenever you judge a creature you can spend 1 wrath to channel your divine power to make them afraid. If the target has P \< average, they are frightened of you (save ends). Whenever a creature judged by you to is reduced to 0 Stamina and you judge a new target as a free triggered action, if that new target has P \< strong, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already frightened of you, they take damage equal to twice your Presence score instead.
