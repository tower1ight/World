# Word Of Fate Denied

When an ally within 10 squares of you takes damage that would make them start dying, you can transfer the harm to yourself or another willing creature within 10 squares of you as a free triggered action. The creature you choose takes the damage instead and suffers any effect associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.
