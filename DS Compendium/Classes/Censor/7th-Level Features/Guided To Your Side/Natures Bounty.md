# Nature's Bounty

Whenever you finish a respite, you prepare a magic meal of local flora for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following benefits. Each creature who consumes the meal gains those benefits until they finish another respite.

- Each creature gains acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic immunity equal to your level. You can choose this benefit twice, choosing a new damage immunity each time.

- Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina that lasts until the end of their next respite if it doesn't disappear through damage first.

- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.

- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.

- Each creature has an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.
