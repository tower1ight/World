# Ride The Lightning

Lightning and thunder are infused in your body. When you deal damage to another creature with an ability, that ability deals additional lightning damage equal to your Presence score. If you use an ability that force moves a creature, you can force move them an extra number of squares equal to your Presence score. While under the effects of the Windwalk ability you speed increases by your Might score, as you use lightning to enhance your locomotion.
