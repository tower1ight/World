# Gods' Library

You can gain access to information you need through prayer and no longer require research materials for crafting and research projects. You can add your level to project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. Additionally, you gain all the skills in the lore skill group you don't already have, and can gain a number of skills equal to the number you already had in the lore skill group before gaining this feature.
