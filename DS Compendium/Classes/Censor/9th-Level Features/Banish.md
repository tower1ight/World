# Banish (11 Wrath)

*You sever the target's tenuous connection to the world.*

| **Keywords:** Melee, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** 1 creature |

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **5 + M damage; P \< \[weak\] suffer Effect (save ends)** - *12-16:* **8 + M damage; P \< \[average\] suffer Effect (save ends)** - *17+:* **11 + M damage; P \< \[strong\] suffer Effect (save ends)**

**Effect:** The target is banished to another manifold in the timescape and removed from the encounter. While removed the only action they can take is to make saving throws. While banished, whenever the target rolls to save against any effect they take 10 holy damage. If they are reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to the timescape. This ability has an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures not native to Orden. If you know the true name of the target this ability has a double edge.
