# Protective Circle

You can spend 10 minutes working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on THE GROUND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A SIZE 1 CREATURE. The circle lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it (no action required). ONLY creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective area, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.
