# Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. When you perform the ritual, the chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level, which lasts until you finish another respite.
