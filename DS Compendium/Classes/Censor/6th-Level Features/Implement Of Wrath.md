# Implement Of Wrath

At the end of each respite you can select one hero's weapon, including your own, to be enchanted as an implement of your god's wrath until your next respite.

The enchanted weapon gains the following benefits:

- Strikes with this weapon do additional holy damage equal to the wielder's highest characteristic score.
- Creatures with holy weakness that are struck by this weapon are **P \< \[strong\] weakened and frightened** (save ends).
- Any minions targeted with strike using this weapon die instantly, with the minion's Stamina maximum removed from the minion pool, before damage is applied to the rest of the squad.
- The wielder is immune to the frightened condition.
