| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Action           |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** Self or 1 ally |

**Effect:** The target ends any condition or effect affecting them with a duration of EoT or save ends. If the target is prone, they can stand up. Then the target gains two surges and can shift their speed, ignoring difficult terrain during the shift, and can make a signature strike as a free triggered action.
