# Evil Revealed

Your order has taught you methods to see through the disguises of both mortals and monsters. You automatically see through disguises and illusions created by creatures of your level or lower. You have an edge on tests to see through more powerful disguises and illusions. When you see through a creature's disguise or illusion you can use Judgment on them as a free triggered action.
