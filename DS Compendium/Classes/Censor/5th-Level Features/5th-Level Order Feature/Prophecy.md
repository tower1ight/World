# Prophecy

You can now better sift through the constant fragmentary visions from your deity and act to make them manifest. When you gain one or more Victories, you can make a number of 2d10 rolls equal to the number of Victories you gained. Record and keep these results in the order they are rolled. When you or a creature within 10 squares of you makes a power roll, you can use a free triggered action to replace the result of just the dice roll with your first recorded result. You discard a result once it is used and the one after it becomes the first recorded result. All remaining rolls are discarded when you finish a respite.
