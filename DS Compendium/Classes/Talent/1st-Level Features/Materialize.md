# Materialize

*You picture an object in your mind and give it form in the world, directly above your opponent's head.*

| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Resopathy, Strike | **Type:** Action                   |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                          | **Target:** One creature or object |

Power Roll + Reason: - *11 or lower:* **3 + R damage** - *12-16:* **5 + R damage** - *17+:* **8 + R damage**

**Effect:** A size 1M object drops onto the target and then rolls into an adjacent, unoccupied space of your choice. The object is made of wood, stone, or metal (your choice).

**Strained:** The object is explodes on impact, dealing damage equal to your Reason score to each creature adjacent to the target. You also take damage equal to your Reason score, which can't be reduced in any way.
