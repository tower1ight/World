- **Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things
- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air of the environment around you
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it
- **Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects
- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures

As a talent gains mastery over their mind, they are drawn to a tradition that can be manifested as easily as breathing. Choose one of the following talent traditions: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. (*Quick Build:* telekinesis) Your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain from this class. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future products.)
