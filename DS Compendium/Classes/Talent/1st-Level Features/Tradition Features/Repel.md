| **Distance:** Ranged 10       | **Target:** Self or one ally |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage or is force moved.

**Effect:** The triggering damage is halved or distance of the triggering forced movement is reduced by a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If the target was damaged and force moved, you choose the effect. If the triggering forced movement is reduced to 0 squares, the target pushes the source of the forced movement a number of squares equal to your Reason score.
