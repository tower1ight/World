# Clarity Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

Additionally, if you use two or more abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using those abilities or effects.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.
