Power Roll + Reason: - *11 or lower:* **2 fire damage** - *12-16:* **4 fire damage** - *17+:* **6 fire damage**

**Effect:** A column of fire lingers in the area until the start of your next turn. Each enemy who enters the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 2 fire damage.

**Strained:** The size of the cube increases by 2, but the fire disappears at the end of your turn.
