# Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them, building up a Heroic Resource called insight.

## Insight In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight. The first time each round that you deal damage with at least one surge, you gain 1 insight. You lose any remaining insight at the end of the encounter.

When you use a heroic ability that has a power roll, that ability costs 1 less insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability has an edge or double edge against only one target.

## Insight Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight on it equal to your Victories.
