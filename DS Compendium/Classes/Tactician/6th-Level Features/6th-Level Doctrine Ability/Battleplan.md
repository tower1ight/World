# Battleplan (9 Focus)

*With new understanding of your foes, you create the perfect plan to win the encounter.*

|                         |                         |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Maneuver      |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 3 creatures |

**Effect:** Each target is marked by you. Immediately and for the rest of the encounter, the Director tells you if any marked enemies have damage immunity or weakness and what the value of either is. You and all allies within 3 squares of you gain two surges.

**Mark Benefit:** For the rest of the encounter whenever you or an ally attacks a marked target, you can spend 2 focus to make the ability ignore damage immunity and deal additional damage equal to triple your Reason score.
