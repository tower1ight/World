**Trigger:** An ally deals damage to a creature with an ability while hidden.

**Effect**: If the target of the ally's ability is a non-leader or non-solo creature, they are reduced to 0 Stamina. If the target of the ally's ability is a minion, the entire squad is killed. If the target is a leader or a solo creature, the ally's ability power roll automatically achieves tier 3.
