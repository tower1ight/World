| **Keywords:** Ranged, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Triggered   |
| **Distance:** Ranged 5               | **Target:** One enemy |

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to an ally.

**Effect:** You move up to your speed toward the target, ending your move in the nearest square adjacent to them if you can. The triggering ally can spend a Recovery, and gains 5 Temporary Stamina for each enemy you move past while moving to the target. You then make a power roll against the target.

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **R** \< weak\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\* - *12-16:* **R** \< average\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\* - *17+:* **R** \< strong\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*
