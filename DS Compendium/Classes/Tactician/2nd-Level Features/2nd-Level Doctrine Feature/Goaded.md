# Goaded

You have learned to leverage the psychology of your marked foes and goad them into acting before they are tactically ready. When a creature marked by you uses a strike that targets you or an ally, you can use a free triggered action to retarget the attack to you or another one of your allies or yourself. The new target must be a valid option for the strike.
