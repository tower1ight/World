# Melee Superiority

After constant drills you have improved your ability to anticipate an enemy's attack and thwart their attempts to move freely across the battlefield. Whenever you make an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

**Mark Benefit:** You can spend 2 focus to make a melee free strike against a marked creature who attempts to move or Disengage within distance of your melee free strike as a free triggered action. If you do, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.
