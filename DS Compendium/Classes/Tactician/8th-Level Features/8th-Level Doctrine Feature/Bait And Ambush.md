# Bait And Ambush

You have trained your squad to be silent ambushers.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or an ally target a marked creature with a strike, you can spend 2 focus to have them shift up to a number of squares up to your Reason score and take the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver once at any point during the shift. This shift can take place either before or after the strike is resolved.
