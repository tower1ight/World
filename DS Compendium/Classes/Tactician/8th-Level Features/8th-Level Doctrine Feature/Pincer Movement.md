# Pincer Movement

You have trained your squad to coordinate their movements to maximize combat impact.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or an ally targets a marked creature with a strike, you can spend 2 focus to have them and one additional ally of your choice within 10 squares of you, including yourself, shift a number of squares equal to your Reason score before the strike is resolved.
