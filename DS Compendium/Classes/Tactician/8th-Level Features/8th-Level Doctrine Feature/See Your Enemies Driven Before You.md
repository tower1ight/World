# See Your Enemies Driven Before You

You have trained your squad to maximize impact and to break enemy lines when they attack.

**Mark Benefit:** When you or an ally make a melee Strike against a marked creature, you can spend 2 focus to have the ally push the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score and then shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score as long as they end their movement adjacent to the target.
