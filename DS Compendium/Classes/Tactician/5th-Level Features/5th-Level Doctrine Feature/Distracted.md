# Distracted

You have mastered the ability to read where your targets are paying attention and how to distract them, allowing you and your allies to take advantage of their gaps in attention.

Creatures marked by you do not count as observers when you or your allies choose to hide. You and your allies can use other allies as cover for the purpose of hiding.
