# Squad! Hit And Run! (11 Focus)

*I had to pry this secret from the shadow colleges.*

| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Action              |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** Self and 2 allies |

**Effect:** Each target gains two surges and uses a signature ability with an edge as a free triggered action. After resolving their ability power rolls, each target can shift 2 and become hidden, even without cover or concealment, and even if observed.
