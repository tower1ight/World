# Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Downtime Projects for more information.)

Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following test results apply to a combat encounter:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.

The following test results apply to a negotiation:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you three different motivations, one of which is one of an NPC's motivations, while the other two are not.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you one of an NPC's motivations.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.
