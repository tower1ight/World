# I'll Open And You'll Close (11 Focus)

*You create an opening for an ally.*

|                                             |                        |
| :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1 or ranged 5           | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **6 + M damage**
- *12-16:* **10 + M damage**
- *17+:* **14 + M damage**

**Effect:** One ally within 10 can use a heroic ability against the target as a free triggered action without spending any heroic resources, as long as they have enough heroic resources to pay for the ability. If an ability is left to be resolved and the target was reduced to 0 Stamina, the ability user can pick a different target.
