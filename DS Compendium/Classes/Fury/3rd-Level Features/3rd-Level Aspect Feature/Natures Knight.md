# Nature's Knight

You can speak with animals and elementals. You automatically sense the presence of any animal or elemental within 10 squares of you, even if they are hidden. If you are in a negotiation with an animal or elemental, you treat your Renown as 1 higher than usual. This stacks with the increase to your Renown in a negotiation with an animal of your type while in animal form (see Stormwight Kits).
