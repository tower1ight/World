# Primordial Strike

You can manifest your Rage directly as an elemental force from the Primordial Chaos. As part of any strike, you can spend 1 rage to gain a surge which you must use to add damage on that strike. The surge's damage is in acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic (your choice).
