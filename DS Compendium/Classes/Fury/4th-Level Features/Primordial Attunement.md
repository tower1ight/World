# Primordial Attunement

You begin to learn that your Rage is a manifestation of the elemental forces of the Primordial Chaos and can detect if a creature is weak or immune to elemental power. You can sense if any creature with 10 squares of you has damage immunity or damage weakness to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage. You know if the creature has an immunity or weakness and the specific damage type that applies. You can also sense any source of one of those damage types within 10 squares of you, such as a fire or a source of elemental power.
