# Special Delivery (5 Rage)

*You ready?*

|                                     |                              |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Melee, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Maneuver           |
| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** One willing ally |

**Effect:** You vertically push the target up to 4 squares. This forced movement ignores the target's stability, and the target takes no damage from the move. At the end of this movement, the target can make a free strike that deals additional damage equal to your Might score.
