# Wrecking Ball (5 Rage)

*It is easier to destroy than to create. Much easier, in fact!*

| **Distance:** Self          | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** You move up to your speed in a straight line. During this movement, you can move through mundane structures, including walls, which are difficult terrain for you. You automatically destroy each square of structure you move through and leave behind a square of difficult terrain.

Additionally, you make one power roll that targets each enemy you come adjacent to during the move.

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **Push 1** - *12-16:* **Push 2** - *17+:* **Push 3**
