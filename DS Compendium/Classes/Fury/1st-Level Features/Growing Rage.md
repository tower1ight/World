# Growing Rage

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of rage you have. See the various Aspect Features sections for details. The benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of rage you spend during your turn.

Some of the benefits of your Growing Rage can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, as noted on the Growing Rage tables.
