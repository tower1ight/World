# Rage

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

## Rage In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain rage equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 rage. Additionally, the first time each round that you take damage, you gain 1 rage. The first time in an encounter that you become winded or dying, you gain 1d3 rage. You lose any remaining rage at the end of the encounter.

## Rage Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain rage outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost rage without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs rage, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited rage on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of rage on it equal to your Victories.
