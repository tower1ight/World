# Primordial Cunning

You are never surprised. Additionally, whenever you would push a target with forced movement, you can slide them instead.

As your rage grows, your primordial cunning intensifies, granting benefits from the Primordial Cunning Growing Rage table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.
