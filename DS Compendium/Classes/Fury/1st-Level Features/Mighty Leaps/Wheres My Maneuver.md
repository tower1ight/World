# Where's My Maneuver?

Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, many folks have asked during playtesting, "Where is the fury's special maneuver?" The answer is that the fury doesn't need a maneuver all their own, because most the time, we've found that the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.
