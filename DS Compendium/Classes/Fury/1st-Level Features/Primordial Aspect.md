# Primordial Aspect

You are a product of customs older than civilization, older than warfare, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape--the Primordial Chaos--and which left an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you channel the rage that shapes you, you choose a primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Berserker):

- **Berserker:** You channel your rage into expressions of physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your rage into instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of civilization. You gain the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your rage into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain the Track skill.

Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.
