**Trigger:** The target would be force moved.

**Effect:** You can select a new target of the same size or smaller within distance to be force moved instead, and you can turn that forced movement into a push instead. You become the source of the forced movement and decide where the new target's destination. Additionally, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Might score.

**Spend 1 Rage:** The forced movement distance instead gains a bonus equal to twice your Might score.
