# Prone

While you are prone, you are flat on the ground, strikes you make take a bane, and melee abilities made against you gain an edge. You must [[Crawl|crawl]] to move along the ground, which costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you [[Crawl|crawl]]. You can't climb, [[Jump|jump]], swim, or [[Fly|fly]] while prone. If you are climbing, flying, or jumping while you are knocked prone, you fall.

While prone, you can [[Stand Up|stand up]] as a maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat), unless the ability or effect that imposed the condition says otherwise. You can use a maneuver to make an adjacent prone creature [[Stand Up|stand up]].
