# Restrained

While you are restrained, your speed is 0, you can't use the [[Stand Up]] maneuver, and you can't be force moved. Your ability power rolls take a bane, abilities against you gain an edge, and you have a bane on Might and Agility tests.

If you [[Teleport|teleport]] while restrained, the condition ends.
