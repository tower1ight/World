# Grabbed

While you are grabbed, your speed is 0, you can't be force moved, you can't use the [[Knockback]] maneuver, and you take a bane on abilities that don't target the creature grabbing you. If the creature grabbing you moves, they bring you with them. If the creature's size is equal to or less than yours, their speed is halved while they have you grabbed.

The creature grabbing you can use a maneuver to move you into an unoccupied space adjacent to them.

The creature grabbing you can end the [[Grab|grab]] at any time (no action required). You can also attempt to escape being grabbed using the [[Escape Grab]] maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat). If you [[Teleport|teleport]] or if the creature grabbing you is force moved to a space that isn't adjacent to you, you are no longer grabbed.
