# Frightened

If you are frightened, ability power rolls you make against the source of your fear take a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability power rolls against you gain an edge. You can't willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know the location of that source. If you gain the frightened condition from one source while already

frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.
