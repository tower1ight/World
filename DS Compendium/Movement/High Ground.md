# High Ground

When you use an ability against a creature or object while standing on ground and occupying a space that is fully above the space the target takes up, with the bottom of your space higher than the top of the target's space, you gain an edge on the power roll against that target. You can get this the benefit while climbing if your speed has the Climb keyword.
