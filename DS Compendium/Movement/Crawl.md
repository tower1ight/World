# Crawl

If you are [[Prone|prone]] (see Conditions), you can remain [[Prone|prone]] and crawl on the ground. Doing so costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. If you intentionally want to crawl, you can fall [[Prone|prone]] as a free maneuver on your turn. While voluntarily [[Prone|prone]], you can choose to stand as a free maneuver.
