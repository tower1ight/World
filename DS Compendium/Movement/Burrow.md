# Burrow

A creature with "burrow" in their speed entry can move through dirt vertically or horizontally, and either has the means to breathe while doing so or doesn't require air to live. Such creatures can't move through more solid ground, such as stone, unless their stat block says otherwise.

A creature who can't burrow can dig through soft, borrowable earth by spending 3 squares of movement for every 1 square they move.
