# Shifting

Shifting is a careful form of movement that allows your hero to move safely by dangerous foes. Certain abilities, features, and other rules allow you to shift a specific number of squares, sometimes up to your speed. Whenever you shift, creatures can't make opportunity attacks against you during your movement (see [[Free Strike|Free Strikes]]). You can't shift into difficult or [[Damaging Terrain|damaging terrain]].
