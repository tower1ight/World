# Falling

When you fall 2 or more squares, you take 2 damage for each square you fall (to a maximum of 50 damage), then you land [[Prone|prone]]. When you fall, you reduce the effective height of the fall by a number of squares equal to your Agility score (minimum 0). Falling into liquid that is at least 1 square deep reduces the effective height of a fall by 4 squares.

Falling is not [[Forced Movement|forced movement]], but being force moved downward is considered falling (see [[Forced Movement]] in Combat). Movement from falling doesn't provoke opportunity attacks (see Opportunity Attacks).

## Falling Onto Another Creature

If you land on another creature when you fall, that creature takes the same damage you do from the fall. You then land [[Prone|prone]] in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice. If your size is greater than the creature's Might score, the creature also falls [[Prone|prone]].

## Falling Far

When you first fall from a great height, you fall 100 squares in the first round. At the end of each subsequent round that you remain falling, you fall another 100 squares.
