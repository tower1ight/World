# Climb Or Swim

If a creature's speed entry includes the word "climb," they can climb across vertical and horizontal surfaces at full speed. Likewise, if a creature has "swim" in their speed entry, they can swim in liquid at full speed.

Creatures without those types of movement can still climb or swim when a rule allows them to move, but each square of climbing or swimming costs 2 squares of movement. If a surface is difficult to climb (for instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered wall) or a liquid is hard to swim through (a raging river or whirlpool), the Director can call for a Might test. On a failure, a creature can't climb or swim but wastes no movement in the attempt. The Director can also impose other consequences to failure, such as being caught in the spinning current of a whirlpool.

## Climbing Other Creatures

You can attempt to climb a creature whose size is greater than yours. If the creature is willing, you can climb them without any trouble. If the creature is unwilling, you make the following test:

Power Roll + Might or Agility: - *11 or lower:* You fail to climb the creature, and they can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against you. - *12-16:* You fail to climb the creature. - *17+:* You climb the creature.

While you climb or [[Ride|ride]] a creature, you gain an edge to melee abilities used against them. The creature can use a maneuver to attempt to knock you off. If you are knocked off a creature, you must make the following test:

Power Roll + Might or Agility: - *11 or lower:* You fall off the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice, taking [[Falling|falling]] damage and landing [[Prone|prone]] as usual (see [[Falling]] in Adventuring). - *12-16:* You slide down the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice and don't land [[Prone|prone]]. - *17+:* You continue to hold on to the creature.

If you are knocked [[Prone|prone]] while climbing or riding a creature, you fall and land [[Prone|prone]] in an adjacent space of your choice, taking damage as usual from the fall.
