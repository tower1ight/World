# Fly

A creature who can fly can move through the air vertically or horizontally at full speed and stay still in midair. If a flying creature is knocked [[Prone|prone]] or has their speed reduced to 0, they fall (see [[Falling]]).

If a creature who can fly also has the Hover keyword in their speed, they remain in the air and don't fall even if they are knocked [[Prone|prone]] or their speed is reduced to 0.
