# Martial

Heroes who have a martial upbringing are raised by warriors. These might be the soldiers of an established army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around combat. Heroes with a martial upbringing are always ready for a fight--and they know how to finish that fight.

**Skill Options:** One of the Alertness, Blacksmithing, Climb, Endurance, Fletching, Intimidate, Monsters, Ride, Strategy, or Track skills. (*Quick Build:* Intimidate)
