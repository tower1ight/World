# But I Really Want Alertness

If the culture you create doesn't grant a skill that you want, check with your Director about modifying what the culture's aspects offer. For instance, you can easily make the case that a culture with the illegal upbringing aspect should give a character access to the Alertness skill, given that being successful in battle means always being aware of your surroundings.
