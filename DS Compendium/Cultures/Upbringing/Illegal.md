# Illegal

Heroes with an illegal upbringing had caregivers who performed activities that other folk--whether within or outside their culture--considered unlawful. A band of pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of spies all commit unlawful acts for money. People with illegal upbringings typically don't mind breaking the rules when it suits them--and are good at making sure no one finds out they did.
