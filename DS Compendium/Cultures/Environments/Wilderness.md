# Wilderness

A wilderness culture doesn't attempt to tame the terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest, swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their sustenance and shelter from the land itself. A wilderness culture might be a circle of druids protecting a great wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the land for all they need to live, typically crafting their own tools, clothing, and more.

**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or exploration skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Endurance)
