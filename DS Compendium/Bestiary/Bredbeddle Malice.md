# Bredbeddle Malice

At the start of any [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Engreen (3 Malice)**: The [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s axe lengthens and turns a ghastly green, increasing the distance of the [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s melee attack and the dimensions of their area abilities by 1 until the end of their turn.

- **Shadow Stockade (5 Malice)**: A shadowy size 1L stockade seeps out from under the [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s feet into an unoccupied square within 10 squares. When a size 1L or smaller enemy enters the stockade's square, they are [[Restrained|restrained]] (save ends). When a [[Restrained|restrained]] creature frees themselves, the stockade [[Fade|fades]] away. At the start of each of the [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s subsequent turns, they can slide the stockade and any creature in it up to 3 squares.

- **Green Phantom (7 Malice)**: A phantom second [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]] phases into view, appearing in an unoccupied space anywhere on the encounter map, then vanishing at the end of the round. The phantom [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]] shares the original [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s statistics and current Stamina, has magic immunity 10, and can [[Fly|fly]]. The phantom [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]] can take turns and use the [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]]'s abilities, but can't take any villain actions. Only one phantom [[Bredbeddle|bredbeddle]] can be active during an encounter.
