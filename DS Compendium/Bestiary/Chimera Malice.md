# Chimera Malice

At the start of a [[Chimera|chimera]]'s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Defensive Snapping (3 Malice):** The [[Chimera|chimera]] takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the [[Chimera|chimera]] can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against each enemy that comes within 2 of them.
- **Unstable Terrain (5 Malice):** The [[Chimera|chimera]] shakes the crowd, causing loose rocks or debris to appear. Create three Size 1L stone objects anywhere on the battlefield. Each creature adjacent to one of the objects when it appears takes A2 5 damage.
- **Ashen Clouds (7 Malice):** Until the beginning of the [[Chimera|chimera]]'s next turn, the entire battle map is concealed by a thick cloud of ash. The [[Chimera|chimera]] ignores concealment. Each enemy R1 can't establish line of effect beyond 3 squares until the cloud dissipates. The potency of this feature increases each time it's used.
