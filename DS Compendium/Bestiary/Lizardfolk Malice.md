# Lizardfolk Malice

At the start of a lizardfolk's turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Net Trap (3 Malice):** One lizardfolk acting this turn can drop a net trap on a square during their movement. The net is hidden from enemies not in line of effect when the net is placed. When an enemy moves into a square with a net in it, they must make an Agility resistance roll. If the creature was unaware of the net, they make the roll with a bane:

- ✸ ≤11 [[Restrained]] (save ends)

- ★ 12-16 [[Restrained]] (EoT)

- ✦ 17 No effect

- A creature can use an action to free an adjacent target [[Restrained|restrained]] by the trap.

- **Water Pit (5 Malice):** A lizardfolk acting this turn unearths a 2 × 2 pit in the ground that fills up with water. A lizardfolk that exits the pit gains 10 temporary Stamina, regrows their tail, and ends one save ends effect affecting them. A creature with the Nature skill or the ability to [[Burrow|burrow]] can make a hard Might or Reason test when adjacent to a pit to drain it. Success empties the pit of water. Failure with a consequence causes the creature to fall into the pit [[Prone|prone]].

- **Flood the Shores (7 Malice):** Waist-high water floods the entire battlemap. All lizardfolk submerged in water have their speed doubled while swimming and have **advantage**. The water drains at the end of the round if there are no open water pits on the battlemap.
