# Fossil Cryptic Malice

At the start of any cryptic's turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Floor Mosaic (3 Malice)**: One creature on the ground slides up to 5 squares. This movement can't be reduced.

- **Stone Pillars (5 Malice)**: Two pillars of stone that are 1 square wide thrust 5 squares up out of the ground anywhere on the encounter map. Any creature in the area of a pillar before it rises falls [[Prone|prone]] on top of it.

- **Choking Dust (7 Malice)**: The air across the area of the encounter map becomes thick with dust until the end of the encounter. Each enemy in the dust must immediately make a Might resistance roll, then repeat that resistance roll at the start of each of their turns:

- ✸ ≤11: [[Slowed]] (EoT); the target's stability is reduced by 3 (EoT).

- ★ 12-16: The target's speed is reduced by 2 (EoT) and their stability is reduced by 1 (EoT).

- ✦ 17+: No effect
