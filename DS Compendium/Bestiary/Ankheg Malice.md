# Ankheg Malice

At the start of any [[Ankheg|ankheg]]'s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Burning Maw (3 Malice)**: The [[Ankheg|ankheg]] dribbles acid over their mandibles, and deals 8 acid damage the next time they use their Bite ability before the end of their turn.

- **Geyser (5 Malice)**: [[Ankheg]] tunnels underneath the encounter map cause a sudden influx of hot gas to burst from a 2-square-by-2-square area on the ground. Each enemy in an affected square must make an Agility resistance roll:

- ✸ ≤11: 3 damage; vertical push 5; [[Prone|prone]]

- ★ 12-16: 3 damage; vertical push 2

- ✦ 17+: The target shifts to the nearest unoccupied space outside the area.

- **Earth Sink (7 Malice)**: The area of the encounter map slowly sinks into the ground. Each creature who starts their turn on the ground and can't [[Burrow|burrow]] must spend 1 extra square of movement to leave their starting position, or 2 squares if they start their turn [[Prone|prone]] or [[Restrained|restrained]]. A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space and can't [[Burrow|burrow]] is [[Restrained|restrained]] by the ground (save ends).
