# Undead Malice

At the start of any undead creature's turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Paranormal Fling (3 Malice)**: Up to three objects on the encounter map that aren't held or tethered to the ground float 1 square off the ground. Each object is then pulled 5 squares toward the nearest enemy within 3 squares of the object.

- **The Grasping, The Hungry (5 Malice)**: Ravenous and rotting undead arms burst forth from 9 connected squares of a vertical or horizontal surface. A creature who ends their turn adjacent to an affected vertical surface or within 1 square of an affected horizontal surface must make an Agility resistance roll:

- ✸ ≤11: 5 damage; [[Restrained|restrained]] (save ends)

- ★ 12-16: 5 damage; [[Restrained|restrained]] (EoT)

- ✦ 17+: 5 damage

    Any creature who starts their turn [[Restrained|restrained]] by the arms takes 1d6 damage.

- **Dread March (7 Malice)**: Each undead creature in the encounter moves up to their speed and can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against two targets. If an undead creature is reduced to Stamina 0 during this dread march, they don't die until their movement and attacks are resolved.

## Intensity Tally

At the end of each round, keep an intensity tally of the number of living heroes not adjacent to one or more undead creatures. When that number reaches the number of heroes in the encounter, you can spend 3 malice to activate the following feature.

- **Ravenous Horde (3 Malice)**: Each living hero in the encounter is beset by two [[Rotting Zombie|rotting zombies]] who burst out of unoccupied spaces 4 squares away. The number of [[Rotting Zombie|rotting zombies]] increases to three per hero when three or fewer heroes remain alive in the encounter. Reset the intensity tally to 0.
