# Measurements

How tall is a [[Polder|polder]]? How long does a [[Dwarf|dwarf]] live? The Ancestry Measurements table provides the average adult height and weight ranges and life expectancy for each of the ancestries in this chapter. These measurements are just average, and many folks in the world exist outside of them, so your hero can too!

[[Revenant|Revenants]] are not on the table, since they live until destroyed or moving on after completing their unfinished business and their height and weight is based on their previous ancestry.

[[Human|Humans]] have the potential to live a little longer on Orden than they do in the real world thanks to the presence of magic.
