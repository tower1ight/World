# Ancestry Trait

Each ancestry has at least one signature trait, which your hero gets for free if they take the ancestry. This is a defining feature that other heroes of your ancestry also possess.

There are also purchased traits. You don't get every purchased trait your ancestry has to offer. Instead, your ancestry details a budget of ancestry points you can use to purchase traits. Each trait has a point cost that you pay to grant the benefit to your hero.

For example, the [[Devil|devil]] ancestry has the signature trait Silver Tongue and 3 ancestry points to spend on seven different traits. A player creating a [[Devil|devil]] hero could buy Barbed Tail, Big Horns, and Glowing Eyes, which each cost 1 ancestry point, or they could buy one of those traits and purchase Beast Legs or Wings, which each cost 2 points. They couldn't buy both Beast Legs and Wings, since their combined cost is 4, which is over the ancestry points budget for the [[Devil|devil]].
