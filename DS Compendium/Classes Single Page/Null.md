# Null

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body. You require no weapons, no tools. Any tool can be turned against the hand that wields it. *You* suffice.

As you strive for perfect order, you become an enemy of that ultimate expression of chaos: magic. Those who employ sorcery or psionics to break the laws of nature should fear you.

The null is an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs the effects of magic and psionics. You need no weapon because you are the weapon. Play a null if you want to resist the supernatural forces of the universe with expert calm and confidence.

## 1st-level Features

As a null, you gain the following features.

### Null Tradition

Through extensive physical and psionic training, you have learned to unlock the full potential of your body. As you shape the growth of your power, you choose a null tradition from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Chronokinetic):

- **Chronokinetic:** Your training has allowed you to become unmoored from temporal reality, using the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain one skill from the lore group.
- **Cryokinetic:** You are able to tap into absolute cold, the most essential energy of the manifolds, and manifest its effects in your body. You gain one skill from the crafting group.
- **Metakinetic:** You learn to see through the illusions of the universe to truly understand your body and its psionic potential. You gain one skill from the exploration group.

Your choice of null tradition determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Discipline

As your mastery of your body and tradition grows, it imbues you with a Heroic Resource called discipline.

#### Discipline In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 discipline. Additionally, you gain 1 discipline the first time in a round an enemy in your null field takes an action. You gain 1 discipline the first time in a round that an enemy

uses Malice. You lose any remaining discipline at the end of the encounter.

#### Discipline Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline on it equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the null but might appear in future products.)

### Null Field

You project a psionic field of order around your body, dampening the effects of supernatural abilities harmful to you and your allies.

### Null Field

*You intuit where an incoming attack will strike, reducing its effects.*

|                       |                    |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** Psionic | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self    | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** Each target reduces their potencies by 1.

Once as a free maneuver on your turn, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field has one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:

- **Gravitic Disruption:** When a target takes damage, you can slide them 2.
- **Inertial Anchor:** Each target who starts their turn in the area cannot shift.
- **Synaptic Break:** When a target is subjected to a potency, the potency is increased by 1.

This ability stays active even after encounters end. It ends if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).

### Inertial Shield

Your instincts for danger let you predict attacks before they happen.

### Inertial Shield

*You intuit where an incoming attack will strike, reducing its effects.*

**Trigger:** You take damage.

**Effect:** You halve the damage.

**Spend 1 Discipline:** You decrease the potency of one effect associated with the damage for you by 1.

### Discipline Mastery

The more discipline you channel through your chosen null tradition, the more potent your presence in combat becomes.
