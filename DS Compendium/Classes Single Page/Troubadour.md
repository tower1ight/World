# Troubadour

The whole world's a stage and everyone on it, an actor. No one knows this better than the troubadour. You find energy in the drama of everyday life and know how to draw spectacle forth from even the most mundane of situations. You accent highs and deepen lows in service to whomever would witness your performance.

And beyond the mundane, there are insurmountable dangers that cause many a hero to cower. But the troubadour must chase that drama. The troubadour takes the world stage not to die, but to find out if they are truly alive.

## Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:

- 2, -1, -1
- 1, 1, -1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Presence - 2

**Average Potency:** Presence - 1

**Strong Potency:** Presence

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** Read Person, plus choose two skills from the interpersonal group and one skill from the intrigue or lore groups. (*Quick Build:* Read Person, Brag, Rumors)

## 1st-level Features

As a troubadour, you gain the following features.

### Troubadour Class Act

Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone starts somewhere. Your class act is your art form, summing up the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As you go about unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife, you choose a troubadour class act from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Virtuoso):

- **Duelist:** Drama embraces your every movement done in tandem with another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to return your passion in kind. You gain the Gymnastics skill.
- **Skald:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You gain the Brag skill.
- **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between the vibrations of your sound and filling the audience with your pathos. You gain the Music skill and you wield an instrument.

Your choice of class act determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Drama

During battles, you are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and upside downs of the fray, from which you derive a Heroic Resource called drama.

#### Drama In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during battle:

- **2 Drama:** Three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn for the first time.
- **2 Drama:** A hero becomes winded for the first time (only once per encounter and not once per hero).
- **3 Drama:** A creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20.
- **10 Drama:** A hero, including you, dies.

You still gain drama during combat if you are dead as long as your body is intact. During the encounter in which you died, if you have 30 drama, you can come back to life with

1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action required). You can't gain drama in future encounters while you remain dead.

You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

#### Drama Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama on it equal to your Victories.

### Scene Partner

Whenever you use a skill from the interpersonal group on a test while interacting with an NPC (a bystander, a rival, and so forth) and you don't fail the test, you can form a bond with that NPC. If you then enter into a negotiation with this NPC, their patience increases by 1, and any compelling arguments you personally make to the NPC that would increase their interest by 1 instead increase their interest by 2. You can have a number of such bonds active equal to your level, losing a bond of your choice whenever you make a new bond beyond your limit.

### Curtain Call

You enter every performance with a set of routines at the ready. Routines are auras and other wide-reaching effects that have the Routine keyword, and which center around you while you move through the fray. At the start of each round of combat, as long as you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either set a new routine to be active or maintain your current routine (no action required). Your routine ends if you are unable to maintain it, or at the end of the encounter.

You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick routine ability. Your choice of troubadour class act then grants you additional routines.

## Choreography

*Taps, kicks, steps. Now it's all "choreography."*

|                             |                            |

## 2nd-level Features

As a 2nd-level troubadour, you gain the following features.

### Appeal To The Muses

You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows' spirits to heighten the drama of your present circumstances. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain and achieve the same ends.

Whenever you roll to gain 1d3 drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal to gain the following additional effects:

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director also gains 1d3 Malice.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep for yourself or give to an ally within the distance of your active routine. The Director also gains 1 Malice.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 Heroic Resources, which you can distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your active routine.

### Invocation

You have a specific manner that helps define your reputation among those who watch you fight. Choose one of the following features.

#### Allow Me To Introduce Tonight's Players

Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use your action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each creature on your side can shift up to their speed and gains the benefit of the Defend action (see Actions) until the end of the round. However, any enemies who were surprised are no longer surprised.

#### Formal Introductions

As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival, such as a calling card or a formal letter, addressed to an enemy and have it delivered. You can deliver the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area, send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can have only one notice active at a time.

The Director determines when the target receives your notice. Once the target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per round during future encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such encounter with 2 additional hero tokens. These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.

#### My Reputation Precedes Me

You can invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with a group of creatures who haven't met you before, automatically creating a bond with a representative NPC as if using your Scene Partner feature (see above). While the bond is active, all present heroes are treated as having Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations and influencing tests with the group.

The Director can choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond, making you infamous with the community instead. Until actions are taken to improve your reputations, all present heroes take a bane on tests using skills from the interpersonal skill group with the group of creatures. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the community.

### Perk

You gain an interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

### 2nd-level Class Act Ability

Your troubadour class act grants your choice of one of two abilities.

Choose one of the following abilities.

## Guest Star (5 Drama)

*We offered them a percentage of the gross. So they're working for free!*

**Effect:** Either a bystander within distance is uplifted by your magic, or a mysterious new hero appears in an unoccupied space to help out during the encounter. This guest star is controlled by you, has their own turn, shares your characteristics. Their stamina is maximum is half yours. They have no abilities other than your melee and ranged free strikes. When the target is reduced to 0 Stamina or at the end of the encounter, they retreat or revert to a bystander. An individual bystander can't be uplifted in this way more than once in an encounter.

## Twist At The End (5 Drama)

*You didn't see that coming, did you?!*

**Effect:** As long as the target is not a leader or a solo creature, they come back to life with half their Stamina and become an ally under the Director's control.
