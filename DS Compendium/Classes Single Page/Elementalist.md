# Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mystery. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, put an enemy exactly where you want them, debilitate foes with harmful effects, ward yourself and allies against danger, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your choice of elemental specialization determines which of these things you do best.

## 1st-level Features

As an elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape.

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster your hardiness.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.

Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (*Quick Build:* fire) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain from this class, including one of the benefits below. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.)

#### Earth: Acolyte Of Earth

You gain this feature if earth is your specialization, letting you harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an earth magic ability, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.

#### Fire: Acolyte Of Fire

You gain this feature if fire is your specialization, becoming an expert at wielding destructive flames. Your abilities that have the Fire and Magic keywords gain a +1 rolled damage bonus.

#### Green: Acolyte Of The Green

You gain this feature if green is your specialization, harnessing the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures with a green magic ability that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.

#### Void: Acolyte Of The Mystery

You gain this feature if void is your specialization, using your immersion in the mystery of void magic to hold onto that magic longer than other mages. The distance of all your ranged void magic abilities increases by 2.

### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

#### Essence In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. You also gain 1 essence the first time in a round that you or a creature within 10 of you takes damage that isn't untyped or holy.

You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

#### Essence Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence on it equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the elementalist but might appear in future products.)

### Hurl Element

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

### Hurl Element

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at an unsuspecting foe.*

|                                           |                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Fire, Magic, Ranged, Strike | **Type:** Action              |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                   | **Target:** 1 enemy or object |

Power Roll + Reason: - *11 or lower:* **2 + R damage** - *12-16:* **4 + R damage** - *17+:* **6 + R damage**

**Effect:** When you make this strike, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain

*Draw Steel* (C) 2024 MCDM Productions, LLC

it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 x your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.

### Practical Magic

You have the following ability:

### Practical Magic

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You use the Knockback maneuver, but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and deal damage equal to your Reason score to them. The damage type can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.
- You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### 1st-level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

#### 1st-level Elemental Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earth          | Motivate Earth             |
| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |
| Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

#### A Beyonding Of Vision

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. You always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability.

### Shared Void Sense

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. That creature gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of Shared Void Sense.

#### It Is The Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand Animals, Monstrosities, and Plant Creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with such creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason in place of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, whenever you touch a living plant that is not a Plant Creature, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

#### Motivate Earth

You gain the following ability.

#### Motivate Earth

*The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command.*

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that takes up at least 2 squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it.

You can instead touch a doorway or other opening in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface that is no larger than 1 square. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

#### Return To Formlessness

You gain the following ability.

#### Return To Formlessness

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to combust and melt, destroying it. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object that you touch is destroyed.

### Specialization Triggered Action

Your elemental specialization grants you a triggered action as shown on the Specialization Triggered Actions table.

#### Specialization Triggered Actions

| Specialization | Triggered Action              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Earth          | Skin Like Castle Walls        |
| Fire           | Explosive Assistance          |

| Void           | A Subtle Relocation           |

**Spend 1 Essence:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Reason score instead.

### Enchantment

You weave an elemental enchantment into your body that enhances your statistics. You can change your enchantment along with your ward (see Elementalist Ward) by performing a complex ritual as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Enchantment of Destruction)

#### Enchantment Of Battle

You tap into the elemental mysteries to gain the mind and training of a warrior. You can wear light armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don't have a kit. While you wear light armor, you gain a +3 bonus to Stamina and that bonus increases by 3 at 4th, 7th, and 10th levels.

## 2nd-level Features

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Perk

You gain a crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

### 2nd-level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 2nd-Level Specialization Features table.

#### 2nd-level Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
| Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
| Void           | There is No Space Between |

#### Disciple Of The Green

You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain in this class before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T rodent who fits the animal type. When you take on animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls unharmed to the ground, as you decide. When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

#### Disciple Of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level in this class. Any fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you deal damage with a surge, you can make that damage fire damage.

#### Disciple Of Earth

Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, plus you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level beyond 2nd in this class.

#### There Is No Space Between

You gain the following ability.

#### There Is No Space Between

*Knowledge of the mystery reveals two spaces are the same space.*

**Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces in range, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice within 1 square of the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal you emerge from when you enter a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.

Your specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 8th-Level Elementalist Specialization Features table.

#### 8th-level Elementalist Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Earth          | Summon Source of Earth |
| Fire           | The Flame Primordial   |
| Green          | Chimeric Manifestation |
| Void           | Black Hole Star        |

#### Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull some of the sturdiest titans towards your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target 1 creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull the target up to 5 squares. Even if their stability would reduce this forced movement to 0, they are still pulled at least 2 squares. You can ignore the stability of willing allies with this forced movement.

Your Mantle of Essence also improves. All enemies and objects have their stability reduced by your level while they are within the aura.

#### Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can either enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use the Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. If both animal forms give you the same benefit you select the one with the larger value to apply. When determining speed, choose the highest speed benefit and all movement tags from both animal forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or lower. For example, you can combine a shark (Level 8) with a horse (Level 4), but you cannot combine a shark with a bear (Level 5).

#### The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If it is a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return to Formlessness ability instead.

Additionally, enemies who start their turn adjacent to you have fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or wearing mostly metal.

#### Summon Source Of Earth

You gain the following ability:

#### Summon Source Of Earth

The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you cannot use this ability again until you earn at least 1 Victory.

**Persistent 2:** The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of your next turn.

When a creature eats a Life Fruit, all their Stamina is restored and can end any conditions or effects that are affecting them that they want, including using the Stand Up maneuver to end the prone condition. In addition, if the creature desires, their aging process pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats a second Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging process, the effects don't stack. The pause with the most time remaining is the one that takes effect.

#### Master Of Void
