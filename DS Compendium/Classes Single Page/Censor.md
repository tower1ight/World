# Censor

Demons and devils fear you. Criminals run from the sight of your shadow in the alley. Agents of chaos, blasphemers, and heretics tremble at the sound of your voice. You carry the power of the gods, armed with Wraths and sent out into the world first to seek, then censor those whose actions--or even existence--are anathema to your church.

You're at your best against the strongest foes. Your judgments terrify heretics, stop enemies in their tracks, even hurl them across the battlefield.

## 1st-level Features

As a censor, you gain the following features.

### Censor Order

Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act as your god's agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Paragon):

**Exorcist:** An open mind is an unguarded fortress. You specialize in hunting the hidden enemies of your order. You gain the Read Person skill.

**Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed. You specialize in uncovering long-timescale threats to your order. You gain the Magic skill.

- **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be corrupted. You specialize in setting a visible example for your order. You gain the Lead skill. Your choice of censor order determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Gods and Religion chapter, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick one domain from their portfolio. Your choice of domain determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

(*Quick Build:* Cavall as deity and War as domain)

### Wrath

The power you serve grants you a Heroic Resource called wrath, fueling your abilities as you censor those your church deems to be heretics.

#### Wrath In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain wrath equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 wrath.

Additionally, the first time each round that a creature judged by you (see Judgment) deals damage to you, you gain 1 wrath. You also gain 1 wrath the first time each round that you deal damage to a creature judged by you.

You lose any remaining wrath at the end of the encounter.

#### Wrath Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain wrath outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost wrath without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs wrath, you can't use that same ability or

effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited wrath on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of wrath on it equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the censor but might appear in future products.)

### Judgment

You pick out the enemies most worthy of your wrath and place a divine judgment upon them, censoring them with the power of your god. You have the following ability.

### Judgment

*You utter a pray that outlines your foe in holy energy.*

|                                     |                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Melee, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you die, you use this ability again, or you willingly end this effect (no action required). If another censor judges the target, then your judgment on the target ends.

If a judged creature uses an action and you have line of effect to them, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.

When the judged creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target within distance.

In addition, you can spend 1 judgment to take one of the following free triggered actions. You can't use more than one instance of a benefit per trigger.

- When an adjacent judged target shifts, you can make a melee free strike against them. The target doesn't shift and their speed becomes 0 until the end of this turn.
- When a judged target makes a power roll, you can add a bane to the roll.
- When a judged target within distance uses an ability with a potency against another creature, you reduce the potency of the ability by 1 for that creature (to a minimum of 0).

#### Judgment Order Benefit

When you use your Judgment ability to judge another creature, you gain the following benefit based on your order.

- **Exorcist:** You can teleport up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged creature. You do not need line of effect to your destination.
- **Oracle:** You deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to the target.
- **Paragon:** You vertically pull the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.

### Kit

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See the Kits chapter for more information. (*Quick Build:* Warrior Priest)

### My Life For Yours

You channel your will to mend your wounds or the wounds of your allies. You gain the following ability.

### My Life For Yours

*The first principle of the oath: defend the righteous.*

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn or takes damage.

**Effect:** You spend a Recovery and the target regains Stamina equal to your Recovery value.

**Spend 1 Wrath:** You can end one effect on the target that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or a prone target can stand up.

### 1st-level Domain Feature

You gain a domain feature from one of your domains as shown on the 1st-Level Censor Domain Features table. Additionally, you gain a skill from the chosen domain, selected from the skill group indicated on the table.

#### 1st-level Censor Domain Features

| Domain     | Feature                       | Skill         |

| Trickery   | Inspired Deception            | Intrigue      |
| War        | Sanctified Weapon             | Exploration   |

#### Blessing Of Compassion

You exude a magic aura that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

#### Blessing Of Comprehension

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. For the purpose of making project rolls for research and crafting items (see Downtime Projects), you are considered fluent in all languages.

#### Blessing Of Fortunate Weather

When you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares of you. If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature, both features cancel each other where their areas overlap. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations.

Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:

**Clear:** You and each ally gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.

- **Foggy:** You and each ally gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.
- **Overcast:** You and each ally gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.
- **Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and each ally gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.

#### Faithful Friend

You gain the following ability.

#### Faithful Friend

*An animal spirit is drawn to you, sharing their senses and serving you faithfully.*

**Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal can't physically interact with the world, but they have a speed of 5 and can fly. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their type would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, it is dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage, which can't be reduced in any way.

#### Grave Speech

You gain the following ability.

#### Grave Speech

*You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.*

**Effect:** You can speak to the target corpse (including just the head) of a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

#### Hands Of The Maker

You gain the following ability.

#### Hands Of The Maker

*You can craft objects with the power of your mind!*

**Effect:** You create a mundane object no larger than size 1S. You can maintain a number of objects created this way equal to your Presence score. You can destroy an object created this way with a thought, no matter how far you are from it (no action required).

#### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus on saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Inspired Deception

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Presence on the test instead of another characteristic.

#### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. When you or a creature within 10 squares of you makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

#### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 minutes working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on THE GROUND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A SIZE 1 CREATURE. The circle lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it (no action required). ONLY creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective area, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

#### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. When you perform the ritual, the chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level, which lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Sanctified Weapon

As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the weapon gains a +1 rolled damage bonus with abilities that use the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

### Censor Abilities

You use a blend of martial techniques and divine magic to attack your foes and defend your allies.

#### Signature Ability

Choose one signature ability from the following options. Signature abilities can be used at will. (*Quick Build:* Your Allies Cannot Save You)

## 2nd-level Features

As a 2nd-level censor, you gain the following features.

### Perk

You gain an interpersonal, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

### 2nd-level Order Features

Your censor order grants you a feature as shown on the 2nd-Level Order Features table.

#### 2nd-level Order Features

| Order    | Features                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Exorcist | Saint's Vigilance, A Sense For Truth |
| Oracle   | It Was Foretold, Judge of Character  |
| Paragon  | Lead by Example, Stalwart Example    |

#### It Was Foretold

Your order has trained you to understand fragments of the constant visions given to you by your deity, giving you a momentary advantage in challenging situations. At the start of an encounter, you can take one action before any other creature and before your first turn. Additionally, whenever a montage test is called for, you can make one test before the montage begins.

#### Judge Of Character

Your focus on your fragmentary visions to gain divine insight on creatures and the world beyond your normal senses. Whenever you would make an Intuition test, you can make a Presence test instead.

#### Lead By Example

Your devotion to your deity allows you to take command of the battlefield, letting your allies benefit from your wisdom. When you are adjacent to a target, any ally gains the benefits of flanking against that target. Additionally, each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to aid other creatures with their tests.

#### Saint's Vigilance

You have honed your ability to detect sin and can use it to find those who hide from justice. Any creature judged by you cannot take the Hide maneuver. You have an edge when searching for hidden creatures and, if you find a hidden creature, you can use Judgment on them as a free triggered action.

#### A Sense For Truth

You are trained in secret techniques from your order that allow you to discern the truth at a supernatural level. This puts you in high demand for your church and any governments it is allied with. If a creature is of a lower level than you, you automatically know when they are lying, though you don't necessarily know the actual truth behind their lie. Additionally, you have an edge on tests to detect lies or hidden motives, such as when using the Read Person skill.

#### Stalwart Example

You begin to exhibit a small spark of your deity's power, causing creatures to trust or fear you, depending on what you need. You gain an edge on tests that use skills from the interpersonal skill group.

### 2nd-level Order Ability

Your censor order grants your choice of one of two abilities.

#### 2nd-level Exorcist Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

##### It Is Justice You Fear (5 Wrath)

*I am but a vessel. Your own deeds weigh upon you.*

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **8 + M holy damage;** P \< weak\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*
- *12-16:* **12 + M holy damage;** P \< average\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*
- *17+:* **15 + M holy damage;** P \< strong\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*

**Effect:** If the target is already frightened of you or another creature when you use this ability and it would frighten them again, they take psychic damage equal to twice your Presence score instead.

##### Revelator (5 Wrath)

*You channel holy energy to harm unbelievers and reveal those hidden from your judgment.*

**Effect:** Each target takes twice your Presence in holy damage. Any hidden enemies are automatically revealed and can't become hidden again until the start of your next turn. You can use Judgment on one of the targets as a free triggered action.

#### 2nd-level Oracle Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

##### Prescient Grace (5 Wrath)

*"Hah! I see your plan. It will not work!"*

**Trigger:** An enemy within 10 squares starts their turn.

**Effect:** You can spend a Recovery to allow the target to regain Stamina equal to your Recovery value. The target can then take their turn immediately before the triggering enemy.

##### With My Blessing (5 Wrath)

*A word in prayer, and the gods show the way.*

**Effect:** When you use this ability, the target can use a free triggered action to make a signature strike or a heroic ability that is a strike, and has a double edge on the power roll.

#### 2nd-level Paragon Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

##### Blessing Of The Faithful (5 Wrath)

*The gods reward your faith.*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you are dying, each target in the aura gains a surge at the end of each of your turns.

##### Sentenced (5 Wrath)

*I am the law!*

Power Roll + Presence: - *11 or lower:* **5 + P damage;** P \< weak\*\*, restrained (save ends)\*\* - *12-16:* **9 + P damage;** P \< average\*\*, restrained (save ends)\*\* - *17+:* **12 + P damage;** P \< strong\*\*, restrained (save ends)\*\*

**Effect:** Any of your abilities that impose forced movement can move the target while they are restrained this way.

## 3rd-level Features

As a 3rd-level censor, you gain the following features.

### Look On My Work And Despair

Your judgment has grown in divine power, manifesting your deity's ire against blasphemers, causing them to fear your actions, especially when their allies are smited. Whenever you judge a creature you can spend 1 wrath to channel your divine power to make them afraid. If the target has P \< average, they are frightened of you (save ends). Whenever a creature judged by you to is reduced to 0 Stamina and you judge a new target as a free triggered action, if that new target has P \< strong, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already frightened of you, they take damage equal to twice your Presence score instead.

### 7-wrath Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 7 wrath to use.

#### Edict Of Disruptive Isolation (7 Wrath)

*Gather not together in secret to conspire.*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you are dying, at the end of each of your turns, each target takes holy damage equal to your Presence score. Any target adjacent to one or more enemies takes an extra 2d6 holy damage if they are judged by you or adjacent to one of your enemies.

#### Edict Of Perfect Order (7 Wrath)

*Use not the fell arts!*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you are dying, whenever a target uses an ability that requires Malice, they take holy damage equal to three times your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an additional 2d6 holy damage.

#### Edict Of Purifying Pacifism (7 Wrath)

*Shed not the blood of innocents!*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you are dying, whenever a target makes a strike, they take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.
