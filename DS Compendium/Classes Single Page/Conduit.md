# Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting you increased empathy.

## 1st-level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

### Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Gods and Religion chapter, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

(*Quick Build:* Adun for deity, Life and Protection for domains)

### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety, letting you heal and empower your allies, and unleash holy power upon your foes.

#### Piety In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods--but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. When you roll to gain 1d3 piety at the start of your turn, you can pray to gain the following additional effects (no action required):

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).

You lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter.

#### Piety Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.

#### Domain Piety And Effects

Your choice of domains provides you with extra ways that you can earn piety during combat. These ways of gaining piety are triggered by events that happen during combat. There is a chance that you could have a single event trigger both of your piety effects. For example, if you are a 1st-level conduit and have the Sun domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes fire damage, and the War domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes 11 or more damage, and a nearby creature takes 12 fire damage, you would gain piety from both domains for that one effect.

Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, choose one of your domains. That domain's effect takes effect immediately.

##### Creation Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you uses an ability with the Area keyword.

**Prayer Effect:** You summon the forces of creation and create a wall of stone whose size is 5 + your Intuition score within 10 squares of you. The wall lasts until the end of the encounter.

##### Death Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you who isn't a minion dies or a solo creature becomes winded.

**Prayer Effect:** You inflict a deadly curse upon two enemies of your choice within 10 squares of you. Each target takes corruption damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

##### Fate Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an ally within 10 squares of you gets a tier 3 result or an enemy within 10 squares of you gets a tier 1 result.

**Prayer Effect:** You call on the forces of fate to create a reliable future. Choose a creature within your line of effect. That creature automatically gets a tier 1 or tier 3 result (your choice) on their next power roll made before the end of the encounter.

##### Knowledge Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that the Director uses an ability or feature that costs Malice.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose up to three allies, including yourself, within 10 squares of you. Each target gains a surge.

##### Life Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you regains Stamina.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose yourself or one ally within 10 squares of you. The targets can spend a Recovery, can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn, or can stand up if they are prone. Alternatively, you and one ally within 10 squares of you gain temporary Stamina equal to 5 x your Intuition score.

##### Love Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or an ally within 10 squares of you uses the Aid Another maneuver or an ability that targets an ally.

**Prayer Effect:** Each ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 2 x your Intuition score.

##### Nature Domain Piety And Effect

**Prayer Effect:** Vines whip up from the floor or ground within 10 squares of you, wrapping around a number of creatures of your choice equal to your Intuition score. You can slide each creature up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score. The vines then fade away.

##### Protection Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or an ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina or uses a triggered action to reduce incoming damage or give an enemy a bane on a power roll.

**Prayer Effect:** One ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to three times your Intuition score.

##### Storm Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an enemy within 10 squares of you is force moved.

**Prayer Effect:** Each enemy in a 3-cube area within 10 squares of you takes lightning damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

##### Trickery Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares of you takes the Aid Another or Hide maneuver.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose a creature within 10 squares of you. You can slide that creature up to a number of squares equal to 5 + your conduit level.

You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the language associated with them. For the purpose of making project rolls for research and crafting items (see Downtime Projects), you are considered fluent in all languages.

#### Blessing Of Fortunate Weather

When you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares of you. If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature, both features cancel each other where their areas overlap. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations.

| **Distance:** Ranged 10     | **Target:** 1 ally |

**Effect:** You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal can't

**Effect:** You can speak to the target corpse (including just the head) of a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you.

When you or a creature within 10 squares of you makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

#### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 minutes working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold a size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective area, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

#### Revitalizing Ritual
