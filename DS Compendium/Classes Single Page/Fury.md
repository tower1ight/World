# Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you--you unleash it! Like a raptor, a panther, a wolf, your experience in the wild taught you the secret of channeling unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial chaos is your ally. Leave it to others to use finesse to clean up the pieces you leave behind.

As a fury, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, move you around the battlefield, and grow in strength as your rage increases. Nature has no concept of fairness--and neither do you.

## 1st-level Features

As a fury, you gain the following features.

### Primordial Aspect

You are a product of customs older than civilization, older than warfare, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape--the Primordial Chaos--and which left an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you channel the rage that shapes you, you choose a primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Berserker):

- **Berserker:** You channel your rage into expressions of physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your rage into instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of civilization. You gain the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your rage into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain the Track skill.

Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Rage

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

#### Rage In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain rage equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 rage. Additionally, the first time each round that you take damage, you gain 1 rage. The first time in an encounter that you become winded or dying, you gain 1d3 rage. You lose any remaining rage at the end of the encounter.

#### Rage Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain rage outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost rage without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs rage, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited rage on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of rage on it equal to your Victories.

### Growing Rage

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of rage you have. See the various Aspect Features sections for details. The benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of rage you spend during your turn.

Some of the benefits of your Growing Rage can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, as noted on the Growing Rage tables.

### 1st-level Aspect Features

Your chosen primordial aspect grants you features as shown on the 1st-Level Aspect Features table.

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See the Kits chapter for more information. (*Quick Build:* Panther)

#### Primordial Cunning

You are never surprised. Additionally, whenever you would push a target with forced movement, you can slide them instead.

### Aspect Triggered Action

| Reaver     | Unearthly Reflexes |
| Stormwight | Furious Change     |

### Furious Change

*In your* anger, you revert to a more bestial form.

|                                     |                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Melee, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Trigger:** You lose Stamina and are not dying.

**Effect:** After the triggering effect is resolved, you can use a free triggered action to enter your animal form or hybrid form. You gain temporary Stamina equal to your Might score.

**Spend 1 Rage:** If you are not dying, you can spend a Recovery.

### Lines Of Force

*You redirect the energy of motion.*

**Trigger:** The target would be force moved.

**Effect:** You can select a new target of the same size or smaller within distance to be force moved instead, and you can turn that forced movement into a push instead. You become the source of the forced movement and decide where the new target's destination. Additionally, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Might score.

**Spend 1 Rage:** The forced movement distance instead gains a bonus equal to twice your Might score.

### Unearthly Reflexes

*Elusive as a hummingbird.*

**Trigger:** You take damage.

**Effect: Effect:** You take half damage from the attack and can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Agility score.

### Mighty Leaps

You always succeed on Might tests made to jump. You can still roll to see if you get a reward result.

#### Where's My Maneuver?

Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, many folks have asked during playtesting, "Where is the fury's special maneuver?" The answer is that the fury doesn't need a maneuver all their own, because most the time, we've found that the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.

### Fury Abilities

You specialize in dealing massive damage on the battlefield, mastering a number of unique martial abilities that allow you to strike hard and keep moving in combat.

The last target you damage takes extra damage equal to your Might score for every free strike you triggered during your move.

### Your Entrails Are Your Extrails! (3 Rage)

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **3 + M damage;** M \< weak\*\*, bleeding (save ends)\*\* - *12-16:* **5 + M damage;** M \< average\*\*, bleeding (save ends)\*\* - *17+:* **8 + M damage;** M \< strong\*\*, bleeding (save ends)\*\*

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **7 + M damage** - *12-16:* **11 + M damage** - *17+:* **16 + M damage**

**Spend 1+ Rage:** If you are winded, this ability deals 1d6 bonus damage for each rage spent. If you are dying, it deals 1d10 bonus damage for each rage spent. In either case, you then lose 1d6 Stamina after making this strike.

Additionally, you gain a bonus to stability equal to your Might score.

#### Nature's Knight

You can speak with animals and elementals. You automatically sense the presence of any animal or elemental within 10 squares of you, even if they are hidden. If you are in a negotiation with an animal or elemental, you treat your Renown as 1 higher than usual. This stacks with the increase to your Renown in a negotiation with an animal of your type while in animal form (see Stormwight Kits).

You have a double edge on tests made to search for hidden creatures, discern hidden motives, or detect lies. You also have a double edge on tests made to gamble!
