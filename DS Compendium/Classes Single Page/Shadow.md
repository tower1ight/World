# Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge places you among the elite assassins, spies, and commandos. But more powerful than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemies' weaknesses.

As a shadow, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, let you move swiftly across the battlefield and away from hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the middle of the most heated combat encounter. You also possess more skills than any other hero.

## 1st-level Features

As a shadow, you gain the following features.

### Shadow College

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out or are kicked out--as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You graduated from a shadow college chosen from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* College of Black Ash):

- **College of Black Ash:** The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.
- **College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.
- **College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You gain the Lie skill.

Your choice of shadow college determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them, building up a Heroic Resource called insight.

#### Insight In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight. The first time each round that you deal damage with at least one surge, you gain 1 insight. You lose any remaining insight at the end of the encounter.

When you use a heroic ability that has a power roll, that ability costs 1 less insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability has an edge or double edge against only one target.

#### Insight Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight on it equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level College Features

Your choice of shadow college grants you one or more features as shown on the 1st-Level College Features table.

#### 1st-level College Features

| College         | Feature                    |

You might take on the appearance of a harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might appear as a less heroic, unarmed, and capable version of yourself. While this illusion lasts, your strikes made against other creatures gain an edge. If you use this ability in combat, you gain a surge when you use it.

The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you and any creature physically interact, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required).

**Spend 1 Insight:** Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours, and who is within 10 squares of you. This ability's illusion makes you appear to be that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and changes your voice to sound like the creature. You gain an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the creature.

#### Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to make it easy for you to distract and get away from foes. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and don't initially have cover or concealment. When you do so, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility score. If you end this movement with cover or concealment, you are hidden.
