## 1st-level Features

As a tactician, you gain the following features.

### Tactical Doctrine

Warfare is as old as civilization--and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more developed and complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of tactics of historical significance, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Vanguard):

- **Insurgent (Asymmetric Warfare):** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. By contrast, you'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.
- **Mastermind (Grand Strategy):** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board, and seeking victory by thinking multiple steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
- **Vanguard (Shock and Awe):** You have learned the tactics and stratagems of the heroes of ancient history, letting you lead from the front lines of battle and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.

Your choice of tactical doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Focus

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

#### Focus In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus. Additionally, the first time each round that you or an ally damages a target you have marked, you gain 1 focus. The first time in a round that an ally within 10 squares of you uses a heroic ability, you gain 1 focus. You lose any remaining focus at the end of the encounter.

#### Focus Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited focus on its effect, such as Mark, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus on it equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level Doctrine Feature

Your chosen tactical doctrine grants you a feature as shown on the 1st-Level Doctrine Features table.

#### 1st-level Doctrine Features

| Doctrine   | Feature             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Covert Operations   |
| Mastermind | Studied Commander   |
| Vanguard   | Commanding Presence |

#### Commanding Presence

You command any room you walk into. While you are present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations. Additionally, each hero with you has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation with the other side.

#### Covert Operations

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests with any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist on any test made with a skill from the intrigue group. At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of negotiation.

#### Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Downtime Projects for more information.)

Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following test results apply to a combat encounter:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.

The following test results apply to a negotiation:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you three different motivations, one of which is one of an NPC's motivations, while the other two are not.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you one of an NPC's motivations.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

### Doctrine Triggered Action

Your tactical doctrine grants you a triggered action as shown on the Doctrine Triggered Actions table.

#### Doctrine Triggered Actions

| Doctrine   | Triggered Action |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Insurgent  | Advanced Tactics |
| Mastermind | Overwatch        |
| Vanguard   | Parry            |

#### Advanced Tactics

*Your leadership aids an ally.*

|                                             |                        |
| :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Charge, Melee, Strike, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1                       | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to another creature.

**Effect:** The target gains two surges, which they can use on the triggering damage.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If any effect of the damage has a potency effect, you increase the potency by 1.

#### Overwatch

*Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.*

**Trigger:** The target moves.

**Effect:** At any point during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against them.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If the target has R **\<** average, they are also slowed (EoT).

#### Parry

*Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.*

**Trigger:** A creature deals damage to the target.

**Effect:** The damage is halved. If any effect of the damage has a potency effect, you decrease the potency by 1.

**Spend 1 Focus:** The target can shift a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an additional kit and gain the benefits of both kits, including both their

signature abilities. See Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor, Sniper)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities of both kits.

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

- **Stamina Bonus:** +12
- **Stability Bonus:** +1
- **Melee Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2
- **Ranged Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+4
- **Speed Bonus:** +1
- **Ranged Distance Bonus:** +10
- **Disengage Bonus:** +1
- You can use the Protective Attack and Patient Shot signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses applied. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results to 3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit, to deal 3/6/13 damage.

### Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability.

### Mark

*You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe--with devastating effect.*

**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, you die, you use this ability again, or you willingly end this effect (no action required). If another tactician marks the target, then your mark on the target ends. You can have one target marked this way, but other tactician abilities can allow you to have multiple marked creatures.

While the target is marked and within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect have an edge on power rolls made against the target.

When the marked creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to move the mark to a new target within 10 squares.

In addition, you can spend 1 focus to take one of the following free triggered actions whenever you or an ally damages a target with an ability. You can't use more than one instance of a benefit per

**Trigger:** - The ability deals additional damage equal to twice your Reason score. - The damage dealer can spend a Recovery.

- The damage dealer can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### Strike Now

Your skill at commanding your allies in combat grants you the following ability.

#### "strike Now!"

*Your foe left an opening. You point this out to an ally!*

**Effect:** The target can make a signature attack as a free triggered action.

**Spend 5 Focus:** You target two allies instead of one.

#### Heroic Abilities

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **5 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can make a signature strike against the target as a free triggered action** - *12-16:* **9 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can make a signature strike that gains an edge against the target as a free triggered action** - *17+:* **12 + M damage; two allies within 10 squares can each make a signature strike that gains an edge against the target as free triggered actions**

**Effect:** If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina and a strike granted by this ability hasn't been made, the striker can pick a different target.

##### The Mind Game (5 Focus)

*Your attack demoralizes your foe. Your allies begin to think you can win.*

**Effect:** You mark the target.

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **4 + M damage; R** \< weak\*\*, weakened (save ends)\*\* - *12-16:* **6 + M damage; R** \< average\*\*, weakened (save ends)\*\* - *17+:* **10 + M damage; R** \< strong\*\*, weakened (save ends)\*\*

**Effect:** The first time any ally deals damage any target you've marked before the start of your next turn, that ally can spend a Recovery.

You and your allies within 10 squares of you have an edge on Reason tests.
