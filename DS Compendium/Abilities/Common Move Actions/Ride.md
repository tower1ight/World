# Ride

You can only take the Ride move action while mounted on another creature (see Mounted Combat). When take the Ride move action, you cause your mount to move up to their speed, taking you with them. Alternatively, you can use this move action to have your mount use the [[Disengage]] move action as a free triggered action. A mount can only be ridden with this move action once per round.
