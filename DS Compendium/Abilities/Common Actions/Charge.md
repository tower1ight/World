# Charge

When you take the Charge action, you move up to your speed in a straight line without [[Shifting|shifting]], and can then make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] (see [[Free Strike|Free Strikes]]) against a creature when you end your move. You can't move through [[Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] as part of your movement with this action. You can't climb, [[Fly|fly]], or swim as part of this action unless you have that type of movement as a keyword in your speed.
