# Free Strike

You can use this action to make a free strike (see Free Strikes). Most of the time, you'll want to use the more impactful actions found on your character sheet, just as the director will use the actions in a creature's stat block, but free strikes are always available for when all else fails. For instance, a fury who has no other options for ranged strikes might use the Ranged Weapon Free Strike ability with an improvised weapon when battling a flying creature.
