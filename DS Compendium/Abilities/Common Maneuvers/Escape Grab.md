# Escape Grab

While you are [[Grabbed|grabbed]] by another creature (see [[Grab]] below), you can attempt to escape by making the following test (which can't have a skill applied). You take a bane on the roll if the creature's size is larger than yours.

Power Roll + Might or Agility: - *11 or lower:* You fail to escape the [[Grab|grab]]. - *12-16:* You can escape the [[Grab|grab]], but if you do, the creature grabbing you can make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against you before you are no longer [[Grabbed|grabbed]]. - *17+:* You are no longer [[Grabbed|grabbed]].
