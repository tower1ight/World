Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **No effect** - *12-16:* **You can grab the target, but if you do, they can make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against you right before they become [[Grabbed|grabbed]] by you.** - *17+:* **The target is [[Grabbed|grabbed]] by you.**

**Effect:** You gain an edge on the power roll if the creature's size is smaller than yours. You can grab only one creature at a time this way.
