# Use Consumable

Unless otherwise noted in a treasure's description, you can use a consumable treasure (see Treasures), such as a potion, with this maneuver. You can use this maneuver to administer a potion or other consumable that benefits the user to a willing, adjacent creature instead of yourself.
