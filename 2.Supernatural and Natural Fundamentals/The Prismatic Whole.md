 # what is it
 The Prismatic Whole, a term coined by an ancient group of wizards known as [[{Prismatic wiz}]], is a name for the body encapsulating all [[soul]] known to exist, it is the summation of every [[bond]] and connection in the known universe. As unkillable and untouchable as entropy it is its inverse, when physical energy is disordered, soul is ordered. Every creation and expenditure of [[soul]] has inefficiency and where physical inefficiency takes the form of vibrational energy, heat, its equal, magical inefficiency naturally binds together, reconnecting with its origin, the prismatic whole.  
 
 When all matter is spread out reaching maximum disorder, soul binds together consolidating with maximum order. This universe is a cyclical one, for there is joy and freedom in being part of that cycle.
 
 This inverse relationship means that soul is most dense where there is no physical energy. The two energies can be conceptualized as perfect negatives of the other. What we think of as bodies of soul are really defined by magical disorder due to the presence of physical order, meaning ones "body of soul" is something like an empty space in comparison to the sea around it, and the generation of soul is really the act of transitioning one form of energy into another, draining order from the prismatic whole to form order in the physical realm. into your "body of soul", and drawing the order, and as one becomes more profiecient at gener soul 
  
 
 As pools of sentience represent the individual and their steady state of soul creation, soul is not equally dispersed throughout the whole. The whole is defined not just by dissociated energy. It is the summation of soul,
