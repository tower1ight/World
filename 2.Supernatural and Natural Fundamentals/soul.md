What is Soul
--
Soul is just one more form of energy and the use of soul is reliant entirely on one's ability to conceptualize and perform efficient energy conversion. As far as we know soul cannot be located or quantified is attached to the being associated with it regardless of the planar location or form of the entity.

Soul is the most volatile and unsustainable form of energy known to us. Its decay is dependent on the amount in a system, so the more of it you have, the faster it will convert into other energy forms.


What does it do
--
Soul is inherently tied intent and ultimately leaves the user in three ways: 
- It passively decays, tuning into another form of energy with extremally little efficiency and dispersing
- It is actively [[Magic|channelled]] or converted to another form of energy (as this method has much greater intent the efficiency of the conversion than passive decay it will have much greater effect on the world )
- It is sent to another being, concept, or object through the bond formed in conceptualization

Soul exists almost as a well or pool attached to your identity. Soul in one's body enhances their perception of the world around them and enables them to conceptualize more complex ideas


How do you make it
--
Soul generation is performed through [[focus]], in short meditating on a concept will create it.

When one generates soul they create a [[bond]] to whatever they are conceptualizing, In conceptualizing something they send some of that soul they create to whatever entity they are thinking of. Meaning one can passively gain soul if another is [[focus|Focusing]] on them 

The pool of soul tied to ones identity is reliant ones capacity for [[focus]] or soul generation. As soul decays rapidly the input and output reach a point of equilibrium giving each person a resting amount of soul in their body.
