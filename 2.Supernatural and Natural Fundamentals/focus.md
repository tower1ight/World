Focus is a meditative state in which the practitioner conceptualizes something. This results in the generation of [[soul]] as well as a [[bond]] to the things they are focusing on.

Focus Limits
--
One's power to conceptualize and process is innate. So for example a human, let's say their name is Doug, is born with a given capacity to focus and create soul at rest.

-   Doug is always thinking, passively creating soul in their body which if not channeled in an act of [[Magic]], or into another entity, will quickly decay. The [[soul]] input and output reach a point of equilibrium giving each person a resting amount of [[soul]] in their body.
-   Lets say Doug is passionate about old novels. As Doug studies a particularly esoteric text, the [[soul]] they generate drastically increases and so too does their soul equilibrium. With more [[soul]] in their body, Doug's practice of focus becomes more efficient, subsequently increasing their [[soul]] input and ultimately creating a feedback loop.
    
-   One can imagine this loop would quickly get out of hand, granting doug godly levels of soul and reading comprehension if they were to continuously study. However, as Doug's ability to perceive the world around them grows, focusing on mathematics becomes increasingly difficult. At a certain point the information input of intense soul generation becomes blinding to Doug, and renders them unable to form conscious thought, thus breaking their focus, and causing their created mass of soul to come crashing down with explosive results.Â 
    
-   Let us say however, that Doug was more careful. Imagine they were to slowly build their soul up to a manageable yet substantial point, and then carefully and slowly relax their focus. With their soul induced heightened perception, they might return to a baseline equilibrium that is slightly higher than the one they started with (minute and often noticeable difference)
