A prismatic tome is detailed report of [[Prism]] and their function very few copies exist 

Appearance 
- A completely clear Item, almost like looking through the thinnest glass you have ever seen 
- On its spine in Prismatic it reads "Charge Refract Project"
- invisible clasps on the front allow one to open it 
- its pages are completely black and somehow ultra absorbent of light

the book protects itself 
- when confronted with fire it will grow very cold etc
