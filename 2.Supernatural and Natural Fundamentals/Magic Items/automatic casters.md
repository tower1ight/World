Created by the [[Engineers Guild]], Automatic casters are  devices about the size of a 1x1 ft cube and are capable of projecting a specific spell directly programed into it. How these objects function is one of the best held secrets in all of [[Telor]]. Tampering with one of these objects is not only forbidden by the guild but will result in an alarm sent back to the guilds HQ in [[Allyol]] as well as the transmutation of the devices contents into sand and the subsequent end of the spell it was programed to create. Little is known about how the signal that detects tampering is created, no one has been known to be capable of thwarting it. 

The creation and distribution of these devices is entirely run by the [[Engineers Guild|guild] and one must commission them for a considerable sum of money to create and install them for projects unralted top the guilds afairs

These automatic casters are the backbone Teloric transportation, enabling the function of its [[Trains|Trains]] and [[Teloric Caravans|caravans]], both being technically owned by the guild and outfitted by its technology. The guild, however does not seem interesting in charging exuberant fees choosing charge a pittance in exchange for running and maintain caravans and trains .
