 # What is a God
--
Divinities are essentially pools of [[soul]] large enough and made with strong enough intent to create a beings consciousness outside of their ties to the physical realm. sustained by their believers. The line between gods and mortals is one of scale, nothing necessarily separates say a demon  from a god, however that demon does not create enough [[soul]] to have consciousness outside of their body. 

# Becoming a God
--
- Nearly anything can become a god, though it is far easier for beings with consciousness 
- Ascension often involves the conversion of ones body and mind in their entirety into soul. Manifesting enough soul to focus without the restraints of corporeal form. 
	-   Ascension is not required to attain godhood: though it is common as the consuming ones body can generate an enormous soul boost that can slingshot a being into godhood 
- Consider a rock, a rock has no power to conceptualize its environment, so it has no soul, and subsequently no intent over the world around it. Say a person were to start thinking really hard about that rock for every minute of everyday, a fraction of the soul they generate would go to that rock, and that rock would gain the smallest sliver of consciousness. This consciousness would gain an equally small ability to focus and generate soul themselves. If say ten thousand people had a similar devotion to that rock, they would have enough soul at any given moment to generate complex thought and sustain a considerable amount of focus, enough to redefine their biological limits and exist as a consciousness apart from their physical form..
