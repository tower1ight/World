Magic in this world is defined by the conversion of [[soul]] into another form of energy ie creation of matter, manipulation of light, manipulation of time. The conversion or channeling of [[soul]] relies entirely on the users intent. if they intend to create a fireball they will convert their [[soul]] into a physical projectile and create and enormous amount of heat and momentum to it. 

Ones proficiency in magic is dependent on their capacity to [[focus|generate]] [[soul]] and the specificity of their intent, which generally goes hand in hand with their ability to [[focus]] as with more [[soul]] comes more ability to conceptualize and thus more specificity in their intent. With higher specificity of intent comes higher efficiency in the energy conversion, allowing for less [[soul]] to be spent on a given action.

Magic is generally seen in two categories, the arcane and the divine, though, it will soon be clear that these two are one in the same.


Arcane Magic
--
Arcane magic entails using ones heightened perception to establish or control their connection to the world, converting soul directly into other forms of energy

As ones skill grows they are not only capable of producing more soul but are able to control it with a less clumsy hand so to speak.


Divine Magic
--
Divine magic or holy magic is functionally no different than arcane magic. however, spells deemed “holy” tend to involve extremely complex intent and thus require a level of control of soul that is impossible for mortals to practice (or at least replicate). So when one practices holy magic they petition a [[god|deity]], forming a [[bond]] with them and allowing them to draw in the magic user's [[soul]] and channeling a portion of it to perform the request, expressing their desired intent with all the finite control of a god. 

When ones skill with holy magic increases, they are growing closer to their [[god]], strengthening the [[bond]] between them and learning to communicate their intent with more and more clarity.  It is in that [[god|god's]] best interest to pursue that relationship with the magic user as they will receive more soul when the [[bond]] grows stronger.

Example: lets take raising the dead:  A wizard can reanimate a corpse, casting animate dead, giving it very simple commands, mechanically mending wounds, manipulating the electrical currents in their brain and imbuing it with extremally limited consciousness. The spell speak to dead, cast by a cleric, however, requires the location and complete reconstruction of ones former consciousness. No mortal can consistently do this without aid.
