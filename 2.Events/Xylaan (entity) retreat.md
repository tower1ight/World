 # What Happened 
In response to the [[{unboxing}]], [[Xylaan (entity)]] immediately moves their consciousness away from [[Xylaan (location)]] and the material world to protect itself from attacks from within the [[The Prismatic Whole]]. 

While not entirely abandoning [[Xylaan (location)]] and its people, this retreat leaves them with more autonomy then they have ever come close to having and systems of growth and maintenance that are impossible to maintain without godly awareness and power. 

In doing this [[Xylaan (entity)]] believes that they safely scope out the relevant powers on [[Urat]] and eventually determines that they can wear out [[Tel'Voric|Tel'Voric's]] forces by staying on the defensive and wearing them thin
