 # what is it
The moment that the [[Alchemists|alchemists]] inhibit their [[Germ]] function and break ties to [[Xylaan]]

This is facilitated in part by the [[Cult of the Library]] but mostly due to the creation of communication inaccessible to [[Xylaan]] and methods of blocking [[mycelium|mycelial]] growth and [[Germ]] communication

[[Goblins]] harried them out [[Xylaan]]
